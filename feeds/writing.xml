                <![CDATA[<p>This applies to work tasks just as much as it applies to hobbies. No matter what you do, always create some sort of breadcrumb that you or someone else can pick up down the line.</p>

<p>If you build a feature into your app, you&#39;ve generated an output, and therefore value. But what if you bang your head against the wall and don&#39;t make any progress? Write about it. Write about your challenges, document what you&#39;ve learned and share it with your peers. Not reaching a set goal doesn&#39;t mean failure. It&#39;s an opportunity to create value in a way you didn&#39;t anticipate.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re out on a run and a thought pops into your head, record a memo on your phone, or better yet: <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-09-09-everyday-carry-notebooks">keep a tiny notebook with you at all times</a>. Thoughts slip in and out of our heads at a very rapid pace. Capturing thoughts, even if you don&#39;t share them with anyone else, is a great way to generate value out of thin air.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re into crafty hobbies like woodworking, painting or baking, you likely know how important it is to finish a project. No matter how good or bad the outcome is, every finished project is an artifact that you can look back at later and see the progress you&#39;ve made.</p>

<p>Output always means value, even if it&#39;s not immediately apparent. Just keep on laying down those breadcrumbs.</p>]]>

                Mental AI Fog and how to cure it

                <![CDATA[<p>The term &quot;AI Slop&quot; is currently on the rise. It describes all the AI generated images and texts we see on the internet. I&#39;d like to propose a term that basically describes reverse AI Slop: <strong>Mental AI Fog</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead of <em>consuming</em> too much AI generated content (which also applies), AI Fog describes the inability to <em>produce</em> content without the help of AI. We&#39;re surrounded by flowery written articles and resources that we think that it&#39;s not worth it to put in the effort to write a text ourselves. This is comparable to how computer keyboards, spellchecking and autocorrection have rendered my generation and the ones to come incapable of comfortably writing longform text.</p>

<p>I&#39;m currently strongly suffering from AI fog. I&#39;m so used to letting some LLM flesh out a quick and dirty prompt nowadays that it&#39;s hard for me to write this text, get the point across and not feel insecure about my style of writing. This site is supposed to be a way to persist my thoughts whenever I want to, but are they still <em>my</em> thoughts if they have been proofread and corrected by a computer?</p>

<p>As a result, all these thoughts are piling up in my head. Where I previously braindumped thoughts on a piece of paper, I now only come up with a couple of words and let the AI elaborate. <strong>I&#39;m consuming what are supposed to be my own thoughts</strong>, which perpetuates the cycle.</p>

<p>This needs to stop. I need to get back <strong>creating</strong> things myself. I decided to abandon the use of LLMs for most content on this site. And where AI has been used, it will be clearly mentioned. I&#39;m contemplating adding some sort of &quot;Backed by AI&quot; label for certain pages to make it harder for myself to fall back to a helping hand. I will likely still be using LLMs, but making it obvious will force me to mindfully choose where it will be used.</p>

<p>Is this something you can relate to? Is AI fog even a fitting term for this? I don&#39;t know. And if it isn&#39;t, that&#39;s okay because I came up with it myself.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>My blog just turned five years old! ðŸŽ‰</p>

<p>To celebrate this unique occasion, I want to announce something I&#39;ve been secretly working on: I wrote a book!</p>

<p><img alt="The cover of Five Years of Blogging" src="/assets/five-years-of-blogging-cover-3d.png"/></p>

<p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/garrit/e/233695"><em>Five Years of Blogging: Ideas, Opinions and Guides written 2019 to 2024</em></a> serves as a memoir for the first five years of this blog. It&#39;s a collection of not all, but my most valuable blog posts capturing my ideas, opinions and the lessons I learned. The book is quite messy, but that&#39;s by design. I want to preserve all posts in the state that they have originally been written in. Where necessary, you may find introductory paragraphs or footnotes to explain something in more detail, but the original posts have all been left untouched.</p>

<p>Getting a copy of this book is the best way to support my writing. You can either <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/garrit/extras">buy the book directly on Buy Me a Coffee</a>, or you can <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/garrit/membership">become a monthly supporter</a>, which grants you a free copy after signing up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m extremely grateful for the journey this blog has taken me on, and the people I met along the way. Who knows, maybe there will be a &quot;Ten Years of Blogging&quot; book in the future?</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>Pandoc has <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#links">a feature</a> to covert links to footnotes. Unfortunately, this only applies to LaTeX documents. Since I want to stay away from LaTeX for reasons of bloat, I was looking for a more universal approach.</p>

<p>First, I encountered <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33900067/pandoc-filter-to-add-footnotes-to-links">this</a> thread suggesting to use a regular <a href="https://pandoc.org/filters.html">Pandoc filter</a>. This has one downside though: you need a Haskell toolchain on your system. So I moved on ... </p>

<p>I eventually stumbled across <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/discussions/9415">this</a> thread, explaining how to do the same thing but with a Lua filter instead of Haskell. Since Lua is embedded into Pandoc, you don&#39;t need to install anything. Hooray for embeddable languages!</p>

<p>Simply place the following snippet into file (<code>/filters/link-to-footnote.lua</code> for example):</p>

<p><code>lua
function Link(link)
    link.content:insert(pandoc.Note(link.target))
    return link.content
end
</code></p>

<blockquote><p><em>Note</em>: If you want to keep the original hyperlink in tact, replace the <code>return link.content</code> with <code>return link</code>.</p></blockquote>

<p>And add the following flag to your Pandoc build command:</p>

<p><code></code>`sh</p>

<h1>!/bin/sh</h1>

<p>pandoc text.md
    -o book.epub \
    --lua-filter=filters/link-to-footnote.lua \ # &lt;-- This one
    --metadata-file metadata.yaml \
    --standalone \
    # ...
<code></code>`</p>

<p>After compiling the document, you should now see that each link has a footnote with the link text.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&quot;The nethermost caverns are not for the fathoming of eyes that see; for their marvels are strange and terrific. Cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied, and evil the mind that is held by no head.&quot;</p><p>â€” H.P. Lovecraft</p></blockquote>

<p>I loved reading <a href="https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/f.aspx">The Festival</a> by H.P. Lovecraft, especially this quote by &quot;the mad Arab&quot; at the end of the story. The Festival is one of Lovecrafts first short stories in the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a>. The quote excellently shows the unique style of Lovecrafts short stories. Each story is a grotesque depiction of horrors that are beyond our imagination. I recently tried to replicate this style of writing in  &quot;<a href="/posts/2023-09-10-short-story-haunted-memories">Haunted Memories</a>&quot;, a short story about digital media. I&#39;m just getting started with reading Lovecrafts stories, but the ones I read so far absolutely blew me away.</p>]]>

                A better publishing workflow for static blogs

                <![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="/posts/2023-12-23-100daystooffload-i-made-it">post</a> celebrating the completion of my <code>#100DaysToOffload</code> challenge, I teased that &quot;I built myself a handy script that turns the contents of a GitHub issue into a pull request, ready to be merged as a blog post&quot;. I didn&#39;t believe this was such a big deal, but a couple of readers actually reached out to me to ask about this.</p>

<p>First, some background. My site is built using a static site generator (not that it matters, but I use <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>). The beauty of using a SSG is that every blog post is literally just a markdown file in <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/tree/main/content/posts">a directory</a>. </p>

<h2>The story so far</h2>

<p>Before coming up with an automation, I had to</p>

<ol><li>Copy an older post to a new file</li><li>Rename the file</li><li>Fix the metadata/frontmatter</li><li>Delete the contents of the post</li><li><strong>Write the actual post</strong></li><li>Commit the file</li></ol>

<p>Putting out content on my blog involved quite a bit of friction. I felt like there was a barrier between my thoughts and the blog.</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been looking into how I could solve this issue for quite some time. I even had thoughts to build a custom blogging backend that would commit files to the <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz">repository</a>, which is of course quite silly.</p>

<p>But then it struck me: GitHub issues fully support markdown! The idea was born:</p>

<ol><li>Open an issue in the repository of this blog</li><li>Write the post</li><li>Kick off an automation that takes the content of the issue and dumps it in a new file</li><li>Create a pull request to generate a preview of the post</li><li>Merge the PR once I&#39;m done reviewing the post</li></ol>

<h2>So, how does the automation work?</h2>

<p>The magic lies in <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish_via_issue.yaml">this GitHub Action</a>. It is kicked off whenever the <code>action:publish</code> label is added to an issue.</p>

<p>If for some reason this link will not be there anymore in the future, this is the action as of the time of writing:</p>

<p>&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Expand me!&lt;/summary&gt;</p>

<p><code></code>`yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]</p>

<p>name: Publish issue as post
jobs:
  publish-issue:
    if: github.event.label.name == &#39;action:publish&#39;
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      POST<em>BODY: &#39;${{ github.event.issue.body }}&#39;
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Create commits
        run: |
          export POST</em>DATE=$(date +&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)
          export POST<em>TITLE=&quot;${{ github.event.issue.title }}&quot;
          export POST</em>TAGS=$(echo &quot;${{ join(github.event.issue.labels.<em>.name, &#39;, &#39;) }}&quot; | grep -o &#39;tag:[^,]</em>&#39; | cut -d: -f2- | paste -sd &quot; &quot; - | sed &#39;s/ /, /g&#39;)
          export FILE<em>TITLE=$(printf &quot;$POST</em>TITLE&quot; | tr -cs &#39;[:alnum:]&#39; &#39;-&#39; | tr &#39;A-Z&#39; &#39;a-z&#39; | sed &#39;s/--/-/g&#39; | sed &#39;s/^-\|-$//g&#39;)
          export FILE<em>NAME=&quot;$POST</em>DATE-$FILE<em>TITLE.md&quot;
          export FULL</em>PATH=&quot;content/posts/$FILE_NAME&quot;
          git config user.name &#39;Publish Bot&#39;
          git config user.email &#39;publish-bot@github.com&#39;</p>

<pre><code>      cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; $FULL_PATH
      ---
      title: &quot;$POST_TITLE&quot;
      date: &quot;$POST_DATE&quot;
      tags: &quot;$POST_TAGS&quot;
      ---

      EOF

      echo &quot;$POST_BODY&quot; &gt;&gt; $FULL_PATH

      git add $FULL_PATH
      git commit -m &quot;Publish $POST_TITLE&quot;

  - name: Create Pull Request
    uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5
    with:
      title: &quot;New Post: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}&quot;
      body: &quot;Closes #${{ github.event.issue.number }}.\n\n This PR has been generated automatically.&quot;
  - uses: actions-ecosystem/action-remove-labels@v1
    with:
      labels: action:publish</code></pre>

<p><code></code>`</p>

<p>&lt;/details&gt;</p>

<p>So, when I&#39;m done writing the post, I simply label the issue as <code>action:publish</code>, and the action turns it into a new file, commits it and ultimately opens a PR for me to review. You can see this in action by looking at <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/issues/432">the issue for this post</a>. The action also handles tags for blog posts. You can see that there are a bunch of labels on the issues that correspond to the tags of this post.</p>

<p>One additional benefit of using a static site generator is that I can generate a preview site for each pull request. So, once I&#39;m done writing and the pull request is generated, I can just wait for Netlify to build the preview to read the blog post as if it is published to the site! This is very helpful for spotting typos or formatting issues, especially if I&#39;m writing a post on my phone.</p>

<h2>Further improvements</h2>

<p>There are two things the current setup is lacking:</p>

<p>Firstly, GitHub doesn&#39;t really highlight typos when writing an issue. I&#39;m sure there are ways to address this post-publish, I just didn&#39;t get around to doing that yet.</p>

<p>Secondly, there&#39;s no sustainable way to add images to the repository this way. I have an <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/tree/main/public/assets">assets directory</a> where I put all my images for blog posts. You can paste images directly into the issue, which is really handy, but that generates a permalink on a GitHub CDN, somewhere that I don&#39;t control. For the future, it would be nice to teach the GH action to take these images and dump them into the asset directory.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Using this workflow, I can pump out ideas whenever and whereever I feel like it. It drastically reduced the time from idea to written article, which helps me organize my thoughts a lot better. I also frequently create drafts for things I want to write about but is not fully fleshed out yet.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>This marks post 100 of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com">#100DaysToOffload</a>. These last couple of days, I&#39;ve been sprinting towards the finish line with one post every day to finish the challenge until the end of the year. And I finally made it!</p>

<p>I started this challenge with <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2021-01-11-100daystooffload">this</a> post on January 11th, 2021, which means it took me almost three full years to finish it. The original challenge was to write 100 posts in <strong>one</strong> year, so I&#39;m way overdue. ðŸ˜… But that doesn&#39;t make me less proud to finish it!</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested, you can find the list of all 100 of my posts <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts?tags=100DaysToOffload">here</a>.</p>

<h2>What I learned</h2>

<p>Before starting this challenge, I sometimes struggled with putting out content on this blog. It felt like each post had to be perfect, and if it wasn&#39;t, I was scared to publish it.</p>

<p>The idea of #100DaysToOffload is to let go of this fear and <em>Just. Write.</em> This absolutely worked. I accepted the fact that not every post is perfect and <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-04-01-quality-vs.-quantity">sometimes posting more often with worse quality makes way for better posts</a>.</p>

<p>In order to post more often, I also found ways to reduce the friction between me writing a text and publishing it to the blog. I&#39;ve yet to cover this in a post, but I built myself <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish_via_issue.yaml">a handy script</a> that turns the contents of a GitHub issue into a pull request, ready to be merged as a blog post. This enables me to write posts everywhere I want (like the one right now, which is written on my phone), instead of having to open my laptop, create a new file, write the post and commit it to the repository.</p>

<h2>What&#39;s next?</h2>

<p>I will continue posting when I feel like it! I set myself the goal to publish at least 50 posts a year, but that&#39;s just a rough estimate. If I don&#39;t feel like blogging, I won&#39;t force myself to do it.</p>

<p>All in all, I&#39;m very thankful for having taken part in this challenge. I met <a href="https://kevquirk.com/">a</a> <a href="https://joelchrono.xyz/">bunch</a> <a href="https://claytonerrington.com/">of</a> <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/">like-minded</a> <a href="https://jlelse.blog/">folks</a> that are happy to discuss whatever I&#39;m rambling about, and it&#39;s great to read whatever they are rambling about as well! I&#39;m also thankful for all the nuggets of information I got to share with you, and also with my future self (seriously, you won&#39;t believe how often I&#39;m looking up old posts and being happy that I wrote that down!).</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, until next time!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I had ventured deep into the heart of the forest that day, my heart alive with the joy of nature&#39;s embrace. The woods had called to me, and I, unwary of what lay ahead, had answered.</p>

<p>Beneath the green canopy, in the soft sunlight, I had walked along ancient trails, watched leaves fall to the forest floor, and breathed in the earthy scent of life. The sound of rustling leaves and chattering birds filled the air, and I wanted to capture these moments with my little device.</p>

<p>My phone, the recorder of my adventure, was like an extra eye. Every twisty tree and glistening stream, every play of light on a dewy leaf, I kept them all in digital form. It was my way of keeping a piece of nature&#39;s beauty.</p>

<p>When I got back home, I found myself alone, sitting in my comfy chair. I gazed at the screen, filled with memories of the day. Each swipe revealed a collection of images: the old trees, the winding paths, and the sun playing with the leaves. It was a familiar ritual, going through the day&#39;s photos.</p>

<p>Little did I know that this simple act would reveal a story of strange and unsettling things. As I looked at the pictures, the happy memories started to change. The forest seemed to hide something old and dark.</p>

<p>Amidst the familiar snapshots of trees and trails, one photo stood out, like a misplaced puzzle piece. I stared at it in confusion, for I had no memory of capturing this image. It was a peculiar blur, a distortion in the nature of my otherwise ordinary pictures.</p>

<p>As I swiped to the next image, I hoped to dismiss this oddity as a simple mistake. But with each passing second, my heart sank. The forest in the next photo, while clearly the same place, looked nothing like the serene woods I had hiked through earlier. This picture showed a twisted, distorted version of reality. The colors were dim, the trees bent in unnatural ways, and the sky turned an eerie shade of crimson. It felt like the world had shifted, and a creeping sense of fear washed over me.</p>

<p>My thumb swiped to the next image, my curiosity piqued and anxiety started manifesting at my insides. What I saw next sent a chill down my spine. The distortion had spread, like a creeping darkness, and it now shrouded the entire frame. The forest in the photo seemed to reveal an uncanny life of its own, as if it held secrets it had never intended to surface. The more I delved, the more my phone&#39;s screen seemed to protest, flickering and stuttering in its struggle to depict the incomprehensible. It was as if the very device I held in my shaky hand recoiled from the horrors unveiled, a witness to the sinister unraveling of a twisted reality.</p>

<p>With a shiver in my spine, I continued my descent into this abyss of photos. Each one was a descent deeper into the uncanny, the forest growing more distorted and nightmarish with every passing image. The very air seemed to grow heavy, pressing down on me, as if the forest itself disapproved of my presence.</p>

<p>My phone, now a reluctant accomplice in this unfolding nightmare, grew hotter with every image, as though its circuits strained to contain the eldritch force invading its digital realm. The terror I felt mirrored in the device&#39;s erratic behavior, a momentary dance of dread and malfunction that whispered of a cruel intelligence lurking just beyond the frame.</p>

<p>As the seconds turned into minutes, my heart raced. One last photo showed the forest in complete disarray, and there, amidst the chaos of the twisted woods, a formless void seemed to coalesce, lurking in the background.</p>

<p>This indescribable entity defied the very essence of reality. It was a shadowy figure, a blot upon the photograph that should not have been. Its proportions, though vaguely human, were maddeningly incomprehensible. The creature, if it could be called that, emitted an aura of profound wrongness, as though it were a fracture in the very essence of existence.</p>

<p>It lacked eyes, for it existed beyond the realm of vision, yet it gazed into the depths of my soul. Its presence was an disgrace to the senses, an intrusion into the harmony of the natural world. It was a thing of pure darkness, an incarnation of the void, and it appeared to call forth from the fringes of my comprehension, as if tempting me to explore its mystifying abyss.</p>

<p>My phone, seemingly unable to bear the weight of the strange, otherworldly images, emitted an unsettling, high-pitched whine. Extreme heat radiated from the device, and before I could react, it swelled and erupted into a burst of searing smoke, leaving nothing but a charred and twisted shell.</p>

<p>I was left paralyzed, my mind reeling with a terror beyond description. And as the acrid scent of burnt electronics hung in the air, I couldn&#39;t help but glance up, for I felt a presence, an impenetrable darkness, looming before me. It was as though the forest itself had birthed this malevolent entity, and it was now here, before my very eyes.</p>

<p>What happened next, I cannot say. Years have passed, and my memory remains shrouded in mystery, offering no answers. But one thing is certain: that unholy encounter left me forever changed, and I swore off digital devices, for fear of stirring the terrors that lurk beyond the screen.</p>

<p>From that day forward, I embraced nature with renewed compassion, still drawn to the inspiration of the woods. But I chose a different path for documenting my adventures, one free from the digital terror that had haunted me. A trusty notebook and an old ink pen became my companions, capturing the essence of my journeys as I ventured deeper into the heart of the wild. My hikes remained a source of clarity and inspiration, and through the ink-stained pages of my journal, I chronicled the world&#39;s beauty and wonder, preserving memories in the tangible, uncorrupted form of the analog.</p>
