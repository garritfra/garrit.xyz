                <![CDATA[<p>Embedding models have long been a daunting concept for me. But what are they? And why are they so useful? Let&#39;s break it down in simple terms.</p>

<h2>What&#39;s an embedding?</h2>

<p>An embedding is basically a numerical representation of a piece of information - it could be text, audio, an image, or even a video. Think of it as a way to capture the essence or meaning of that information in a list of numbers.</p>

<p>For example, let&#39;s say we have this text: &quot;show me a list of ground transportation at boston airport&quot;. An embedding model might turn that into something like this:</p>

<p><code>
[0.03793335, -0.008010864, -0.002319336, -0.0110321045, -0.019882202, -0.023864746, 0.011428833, -0.030349731, -0.044830322, 0.028289795, -0.02810669, -0.0032749176, -0.04208374, -0.0077705383, -0.0033798218, -0.06335449, ... ]
</code></p>

<p>At first, thus looks like a jumble of numbers. But each of these numbers points to a specific area within the embedding model&#39;s &quot;space&quot;, where similar words or concepts might be located.</p>

<h2>Visualizing embeddings</h2>

<p>To help wrap our heads around this, let&#39;s look at a visualization. This beautiful image shows the entirety of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5">nomic-embed-text-v1.5</a> embedding model:</p>

<p><img alt="images.jpeg" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72c81f15-c2e8-4ee9-b2ac-c28445de61af"/></p>

<p>Now, if we take our example text about Boston airport transportation and plot its embeddings on this map, we&#39;d see them clustered around areas where similar terms about &quot;roads&quot; and &quot;transportation&quot; are located. It looks something like this:</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot_20240803-114914.png" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf4c9fb9-8d69-4a9d-87cc-e9257b04b4bf"/></p>

<p>In a nutshell, embedding models are able to group terms that are related to each other.</p>

<h2>Why should we care about embeddings?</h2>

<p>Encoding meaning in text has tons of different use cases. One that I&#39;m particularly excited about is building RAG applications. RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation and refers to a method for Large Language Models (LLMs), where, given a question, you enrich the original question with relevant bits of information before answering it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how embeddings are useful for RAG:</p>

<ol><li>You have a bunch of documents in your data source.</li><li>You use an embedding model to turn each document into a list of numbers (like we saw earlier).</li><li>When someone asks a question, you also turn that question into a list of numbers.</li><li>Then, you find the documents whose number lists are most similar to your question&#39;s number list.</li><li>Voila! You&#39;ve found the most relevant documents to answer the question.</li></ol>

<p>This method is way better than previously used techniques like just searching for exact words in the documents. It&#39;s like the difference between having a librarian who only looks at book titles, and one who actually understands what the books are about.</p>

<h2>Other things you can do with embeddings</h2>

<p>Beyond RAG applications, embeddings are super useful for all sorts of things:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Smarter searches</strong>: Find related stuff even if the exact words don&#39;t match.</li><li><strong>Better recommendations</strong>: &quot;You liked this? You might also like these similar things!&quot;</li><li><strong>Language translation</strong>: Help computers understand that &quot;dog&quot; in English and &quot;perro&quot; in Spanish mean the same thing.</li><li><strong>Sentiment analysis</strong>: Figure out if someone&#39;s happy or grumpy based on their tweet.</li></ol>

<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>

<p>Embeddings are a clever way to turn words (or images, or sounds) into numbers that computers can understand and compare. By doing this, we can make emerging AI technologies a whole lot smarter at understanding language and finding connections between ideas.</p>

<p>Next time you&#39;re chatting with an AI or getting scarily accurate recommendations online, you can nod knowingly and think, &quot;Ah yes, embeddings at work!&quot;</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;m currently dipping my toes into Large Language Models (LLMs, or &quot;AI&quot;) and what you can do with them. It&#39;s a fascinating topic, so expect some more posts on this in the coming days and weeks.</p>

<p>For starters, I wanted to document how I got my first LLM running on my local machine (a 2022 MacBook Pro). <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> makes this process super easy. You just install it (<code>brew install ollama</code> in my case) and then run the model:</p>

<p><code>
ollama run llama3
</code></p>

<p>This will download the model and open a prompt, so you can start chatting right away!</p>

<p>You can think of Ollama as the <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> CLI but for LLMs. There&#39;s a <a href="https://ollama.com/library">directory of LLMs</a>, and if a model has multiple different sizes, you can use it like you would pull a different docker tag:</p>

<p><code>
ollama pull llama3:8b
ollama pull llama3:70b
</code></p>

<p>The best thing about ollama is that it also exposes a web server for you to integrate the LLM into your application. As an example, here&#39;s how you would curl your local LLM:</p>

<p><code>
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d &#39;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;llama3&quot;,      
    &quot;messages&quot;: [{ &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Are you a robot?&quot; }],
    &quot;stream&quot;: false
}&#39;
{&quot;model&quot;:&quot;llama3&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2024-06-17T11:19:23.510588Z&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;assistant&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;I am not a human, but I&#39;m also not a traditional robot. I&#39;m an artificial intelligence language model designed to simulate conversation and answer questions to the best of my ability. My \&quot;brain\&quot; is a complex algorithm that processes natural language inputs and generates responses based on patterns and associations learned from large datasets.\n\nWhile I don&#39;t have a physical body or consciousness like humans do, I&#39;m designed to interact with humans in a way that feels natural and conversational. I can understand and respond to questions, make suggestions, and even tell jokes (though my humor may be a bit... algorithmic).\n\nSo, while I&#39;m not a human or a traditional robot, I exist at the intersection of technology and language, designed to assist and communicate with humans in a helpful way!&quot;},&quot;done_reason&quot;:&quot;stop&quot;,&quot;done&quot;:true,&quot;total_duration&quot;:12565842250,&quot;load_duration&quot;:7059262291,&quot;prompt_eval_count&quot;:15,&quot;prompt_eval_duration&quot;:331275000,&quot;eval_count&quot;:156,&quot;eval_duration&quot;:5172858000}
</code></p>

<p>If your local machine is not beefy enough and you want to try out a large LLM on a rented server (AWS has <code>g5.2xlarge</code>, which gave me good results for <code>mixtral 8x7b</code>), you also have to set <code>OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0</code> in your environment variables to be able to reach the remote server. <strong>This exposes the LLM to the public internet, so be careful when chosing your deployment strategy.</strong></p>

<p>And there you go! You just deployed your very own LLM. Pretty cool, huh?</p>]]>
