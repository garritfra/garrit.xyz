                <![CDATA[<p>I just learned a cool trick that I want to share. Let&#39;s review the diff of a file using <code>git diff</code>. I redacted most of it, but you probably found yourself in the situation of extremely long changes before:</p>

<p><code></code>`

<p>But do you spot what has ACTUALLY been changed? In a real world scenario, it probably took you a while before you realised that it&#39;s the result of formatting the entire file. Nobody cares about whitespace when reviewing code. Or rather, your brain should not take the burden of having to care about that. That&#39;s what linters are for!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the same diff with the <code>--ignore-all-space</code> (shorthand <code>-w</code>) flag activated:</p>

<p><code>

</code></p>

<p>Huh, so it&#39;s NOT just a formatted file. All whitespace changes have been stripped out, and you only see the changes that are relevant for the review. Neat!</p>

<p>Many tools also support ignoring whitespace. GitLab let&#39;s you disable <code>Show whitespace changes</code> in the merge request diff viewer. VSCode has the <code>diffEditor.ignoreTrimWhitespace</code> setting. So, if you want to make this the default in your tools, chances are there&#39;s an option for only showing relevant changes.</p>

<p>A bit of a sloppy post, but I hope this is useful to someone. Happy code reviewing!</p>]]>

                Beware of base64 encoded strings

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p>I just encountered a fun little bug that I thought is worth sharing.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: the base64 util breaks lines after a certain number of columns. Use a <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/base64.1.html">flag</a> to specify &quot;don&#39;t break&quot;. Here&#39;s the commit that fixes the issue:</p>

<p>&lt;img width=&quot;1588&quot; alt=&quot;image (3)&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/dba76692-c89f-44da-b70a-f6732a406d75&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>It started when we noticed that a cronjob that used wget to regularly call an endpoint failed on one specific environment. The endpoint uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">Basic Auth</a>, which is essentially a header with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a> encoded representation of a username and password. <a href="https://curl.se/">Curl</a> has this functionality <a href="https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-u">built in</a>, but to keep the attack surface as small as possible, we decided to stick to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a>, which is part of busybox, to keep the container image size under 1 MB (!). After all, all we want to do is ping an endpoint.</p>

<p>This is the command we used up to this point:</p>

<p><code>
wget --post-data=&quot;&quot; -O - --header=&quot;Authorization: Basic $(echo -n $BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD | base64)&quot; http://endpoint:8080/v1/cache
</code></p>

<p>We noticed that the request worked fine on non-prod environments, but it failed on production with the following error:</p>

<p><code>
The HTTP header line [b2verlk1rwjsnutbcapkjh==] does not conform to RFC 7230. The request has been rejected.
</code></p>

<p>After digging around for a while and separating out the individual pieces of the commands, I noticed that the subcommand to build the header value (<code>echo -n $BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD | base64</code>) behaved differently on prod vs. non-prod. The password on prod is way longer compared to the other environments. Let&#39;s run this command with a short input:</p>

<p><code>sh
/ $ echo -n someuser:somepassword | base64
c29tZXVzZXI6c29tZXBhc3N3b3Jk
/ $
</code></p>

<p>And again with a long input:</p>

<p><code>sh
/ $ echo -n someuser:somepasswordthatswaylongerthanthefirstonebutalsoverysecureandsafe | base64
c29tZXVzZXI6c29tZXBhc3N3b3JkdGhhdHN3YXlsb25nZXJ0aGFudGhlZmlyc3RvbmVidXRhbHNv
dmVyeXNlY3VyZWFuZHNhZmU=
/ $
</code></p>

<p>Bingo! There&#39;s a rogue newline character in the output of <code>base64</code>. The fix is very straight-forward. Using the <code>-w0</code> <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/base64.1.html">flag for base64</a>, we can force the output to be on the same line:</p>

<p><code>
/ $ echo -n someuser:somepasswordthatswaylongerthanthefirstonebutalsoverysecureandsafe | base64 -w0
c29tZXVzZXI6c29tZXBhc3N3b3JkdGhhdHN3YXlsb25nZXJ0aGFudGhlZmlyc3RvbmVidXRhbHNvdmVyeXNlY3VyZWFuZHNhZmU=
</code></p>

<p>This eventually fixed the issue. Not something I would&#39;ve ever thought of!</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>Pandoc has <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#links">a feature</a> to covert links to footnotes. Unfortunately, this only applies to LaTeX documents. Since I want to stay away from LaTeX for reasons of bloat, I was looking for a more universal approach.</p>

<p>First, I encountered <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33900067/pandoc-filter-to-add-footnotes-to-links">this</a> thread suggesting to use a regular <a href="https://pandoc.org/filters.html">Pandoc filter</a>. This has one downside though: you need a Haskell toolchain on your system. So I moved on ... </p>

<p>I eventually stumbled across <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/discussions/9415">this</a> thread, explaining how to do the same thing but with a Lua filter instead of Haskell. Since Lua is embedded into Pandoc, you don&#39;t need to install anything. Hooray for embeddable languages!</p>

<p>Simply place the following snippet into file (<code>/filters/link-to-footnote.lua</code> for example):</p>

<p><code>lua
function Link(link)
    link.content:insert(pandoc.Note(link.target))
    return link.content
end
</code></p>

<blockquote><p><em>Note</em>: If you want to keep the original hyperlink in tact, replace the <code>return link.content</code> with <code>return link</code>.</p></blockquote>

<p>And add the following flag to your Pandoc build command:</p>

<p><code></code>`sh</p>

<h1>!/bin/sh</h1>

<p>pandoc text.md
    -o book.epub \
    --lua-filter=filters/link-to-footnote.lua \ # &lt;-- This one
    --metadata-file metadata.yaml \
    --standalone \
    # ...
<code></code>`</p>

<p>After compiling the document, you should now see that each link has a footnote with the link text.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>We&#39;ve been taught that, to prove that a thing is true, we should point out what&#39;s true about it.</p>

<p>However, we can learn much more about why something is true by trying to <strong>disprove</strong> it first. If you think something is true, try as hard as you can to prove that it&#39;s false.</p>

<p>Disproving a theory is core to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">scientific method</a>. Only when we validate that something cannot be false, we come closer to proving that it&#39;s true.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>So, I recently wrote about [why you can&#39;t divide by zero](/posts/2023-11-30-why-you-can&#39;t-divide-by-zero). In that post, I argued that dividing a number by zero breaks the rules of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function">inverse functions</a>. Of course that&#39;s not the only way to prove that the result of dividing a number by zero is not defined, so here&#39;s another.</p>

<p>If you approach the number zero from some arbitrary number as the divisor, you will find that the result is getting larger and larger: <code>1 / 1 = 1</code>, <code>1 / 0.5 = 2</code>, <code>1 / 0.1 = 10</code> and so on. If we keep dividing by smaller numbers, the result will get bigger and bigger. It&#39;s obvious that if we go all the way down to zero as the divisor, we will see infinity as the result, right? Well, no.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s flip this around and start from a negative number, going up towards the number zero: <code>1 / -1 = -1</code>, <code>1 / -0.5 = -2</code>, <code>1 / -0.1 = -10</code>. As you can see, the numbers are getting <strong>smaller</strong>, the more we approach the number zero! This shows that the results differ if we change the perspective on the problem. The result cannot be defined.</p>

<p>After writing the first post on this topic, I honestly didn&#39;t realize how complex this seemingly simple problem is. I&#39;m not a mathematician, but I&#39;m starting to like maths. Fascinating stuff!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>For as long as I can remember, I often had the feeling of not being able to get a full breath. I&#39;m taking deep breaths and sometimes forcing a yawn to overcome this feeling, sometimes successful, sometimes failing and trying again. This feeling gets worse the more I focus on my breath.</p>

<p>I always felt like this is somewhat uncommon, since none of my friends and family can relate to this feeling, but it wasn&#39;t worse enough to justify consulting a doctor about it either.</p>

<p>Doing some research, it seems like this phenomenon is called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath">dyspnea</a>, or &quot;air hunger&quot;. Some guy even made <a href="https://airhunger.org/">a website</a> about it. In a nutshell, it is caused by your body not being able to regulate carbon levels in your blood, which leads to an urge to breath unnaturally.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XliOGg8Tl98">video</a>, the author points out that this might be caused by irregular breathing patterns. Indeed, I often find myself breathing through the mouth or sitting in awkward positions with a humpback when the symptoms are at its worst. In fact, what led me to look this up was because I was annoyed by the feeling while I&#39;m laying in bed staring down at my screen, which is a very unnatural position.</p>

<p>A simple trick to get into a more regular breathing pattern is apparently to force yourself to breathe through the nose. Mouth breathing lets your body take in way more air than you need, which throws off the balance of the carbon levels in your lungs.</p>

<p>It seems like nose breathing does work very well. Where I&#39;ve just been struggling with air hunger, once I forced myself to nose breathe, the urge to breathe doesn&#39;t come nearly as often anymore.</p>

<p>These are just my results after some quick research. The topic of short breathing seems to be quite broad. Perhaps you&#39;re struggling with this as well. In that case, I hope this post was helpful to you!</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I never actively watched a Formula E race, let alone Formula 1. Racing just isn&#39;t on my radar. However, I just came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En-__5ewnAk">this</a> video about the driving style in Formula E races, and I was instantly hooked. Formula E is basically Mario Kart.</p>

<p>In a race, drivers can enter a so called &quot;attack mode&quot;, in which they can leave the optimal route in a turn to activate a significant power burst for a short while.</p>

<p><img alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/712c8317-a669-4a20-8d29-c746aea54392"/></p>

<p>Sound familiar? You bet!</p>

<p><img alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/22c8cf0f-6ac4-491d-8814-a24f937ec3a7"/></p>

<p>Additionally, drivers have the strategic option to &quot;hyperboost&quot; for some time. During a race, the drivers have to balance speed and efficiency. If your battery is empty, you&#39;re out of the race. The cars usually don&#39;t drive with full power to conserve energy, until the &quot;hyperboost&quot; is activated. So thinking about <strong>when</strong> to overtake a car plays a huge strategic role. Does that ring a bell?</p>

<p><img alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/18b326c6-e4db-495e-8cfb-1039f9c39691"/></p>

<p>Formula 1 cars generate <strong>a lot</strong> of data which is analyzed by the pit to predict tire wear, fuel usage, weather conditions and so on. In Formula E, no data is streamed to the pit at all. It&#39;s entirely up to the skill of the driver to make decisions. Again, just like in Mario Kart.</p>

<p>Although I have no stakes in car races whatsoever, I was blown away by this video about Formula E. If you liked this post, I suggest you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En-__5ewnAk">watch it by yourself</a> and let it be explained by an expert.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve always been wondering why dividing by zero is considered undefined. My intuitive answer would have always been &quot;infinity&quot; or &quot;zero&quot;. I just had a discussion about this with a collegue who happens to have a degree in mathematics, and the way they explained it made it absolutely clear why it doesn&#39;t make sense to divide by zero.</p>

<h2>Inverse Operations</h2>

<p>Before understanding why dividing by zero is undefined, you first need to know about inverse operations. It&#39;s quite simple!</p>

<p>An example: <code>3 + 2 = 5</code>. The inverse of addition is <em>subtraction</em>, so the inverse of this equation is <code>5 - 2 = 3</code> or <code>5 - 3 = 2</code>.</p>

<p>The same applies to multiplication. The inverse of multiplation is <em>division</em>. So the inverse of <code>6 * 2 = 12</code> is <code>12 / 2 = 6</code> or <code>12 / 6 = 2</code>.</p>

<h2>Dividing by zero</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s try to apply the inverse rule to the number zero, starting with addition. If <code>2 + 0 = 2</code>, then <code>2 - 0 = 2</code>.</p>

<p>But if we have <code>2 * 0 = 0</code>, the inverse of that would be <code>0 / 0 = 2</code>, which is just not true.</p>

<p>Dividing by zero breaks some fundamental laws of mathematics, which is why there&#39;s a general consensus that any equasion dividing by zero has no valid answer.</p>

                <![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: This post stirred up some interesting discussions on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38110286">HackerNews</a> and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/gnv9ho/tracking_sqlite_database_changes_git">Lobste.rs</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>SQLite stores data in binary. If you run <code>cat mydb.sqlite</code>, you&#39;ll see a bunch of gibberish that doesn&#39;t resemble structured data at all. If you want to track changes and updates to a database using Git, you won&#39;t be able to see full diffs by default. You&#39;ll see that the file has changed, but not what changed exactly:</p>

<p><code>diff
diff --git a/mydb.sqlite b/mydb.sqlite
index f412c72..8f49ea5 100644
Binary files a/mydb.sqlite and b/mydb.sqlite differ
</code></p>

<p>So, is there a way around that? Turns out: there is! Here&#39;s a diff between two states of the SQLite database of <a href="https://www.gnucash.org/index.phtml">GnuCash</a>, which I&#39;m currently trying out to manage my finances. I&#39;ll explain how I got this diff afterwards:</p>

<p>First, add a diff type called &quot;sqlite3&quot; to your config. The simplest way is to just run these commands:</p>

<p><code>shell
git config diff.sqlite3.binary true
git config diff.sqlite3.textconv &quot;echo .dump | sqlite3&quot;
</code></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can add this snippet to your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> or <code>.git/config</code> in your repository:</p>

<p><code>gitconfig
[diff &quot;sqlite3&quot;]
        binary = true
        textconv = &quot;echo .dump | sqlite3&quot;
</code></p>

<p>Next, create a file called <code>.gitattributes</code> if it&#39;s not already present and add this line:</p>

<p><code>gitattributes
*.sqlite diff=sqlite3
</code></p>

<blockquote><p>Note that the filename (<code>*.sqlite</code>) may differ from your setup. In my case for example, it should match files with <code>*.gnucash</code>.</p></blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s about it! The next time you run <code>git diff</code> or any other command that produces a diff on a sqlite file, you&#39;ll see a nicely formatted diff of the changes.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Here&#39;s a quick tip on how to manage multiple Git identities (e.g. personal, work, client1, client2).</p>

<p>I organize my Git repos in three levels. My personal projects live in a <code>~/sources</code> directory. All my work projects live in <code>~/work</code>. This is the first level.</p>

<p>Level 2 is the client, e.g. <code>~/work/client1</code>. Naturally, level 3 is the project repository: <code>~/work/client1/foo-api</code>.</p>

<p>This is how my work directory is organized:</p>

<p><code>
/Users/garrit/work
├── client1
│   ├── foo-api
│   ├── foo-ios
│   └── foo-android
└── client2
    ├── bar-ios
    └── bar-middleware
</code></p>

<p>Now, say that <code>client2</code> demands that we commit with a different identity than our default work email. Besides that, you probably also have a personal email address for your own projects. How do you manage that?</p>

<h2>.gitconfig includes</h2>

<p>The global configuration file for Git is <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. If you&#39;ve ever set a parameter like <code>git config user.name &quot;Foo Bar&quot;</code>: this is where it ended up.</p>

<p>One awesome feature of the .gitconfig file is that you can <strong>conditionally include other config files</strong>, and this is what does the trick. Here&#39;s my <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file:</p>

<p><code></code>`ini
[user]
    name = Garrit Franke
    email = garrit@slashdev.space</p>

<p>[includeIf &quot;gitdir:~/work/&quot;]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-work</p>

<p>[includeIf &quot;gitdir:~/work/client2/&quot;]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-client2</p>

<p>[includeIf &quot;gitdir:~/sources/&quot;]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal</p>

<h1>...</h1>

<p><code></code>`</p>

<p>By default, my name and email are always set to my personal identity. I also store some other global settings here, but those are not relevant for this post. If the repository is located inside the <code>~/work</code> directory, a file named <code>~/.gitconfig-work</code> is included. This is just another gitconfig file. This is what that looks like in my case:</p>

<p><code></code>`ini
[user]
    name = Garrit Franke
    signingkey = 12345678
    email = garrit@work.de</p>

<p>[commit]
    gpgsign = true
<code></code>`</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;ll see where this is going. For every identity, you keep a separate gitconfig file and include it in the main <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. Crucially, this requires you to organize your repositories grouped by client.</p>

<p>This trick has simplified my project onboarding quite a bit. No more &quot;You forgot to update your Email Address&quot; requests from clients!</p>
