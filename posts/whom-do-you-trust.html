<h5 id="tl;dr">TL;DR</h5>
<p>Use a <strong>stateless</strong> password manager like <a href="https://lesspass.com/">LessPass</a> to access your password without relying on a third party to store your data.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-a-password-manager-in-the-first-place?">Why use a password manager in the first place?</h2>
<p>Having a single password for multiple accounts is convenient. What&#x27;s also convenient, is <strong>using</strong> this password on multiple accounts once you have access to a single one. What might be convenient to you, might also be convenient to others. Many people, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225163642/http://uk.businessinsider.com/twitter-says-it-wasnt-hacked-passwords-reused-older-hacks-malware-to-blame-2016-6">especially celebrities</a>, fall victim to this trap of comfort.</p>
<p>To counteract this, people are (and should be) using different passwords for different accounts. These passwords differ in a single letter or digit (Twitter: <code>porridge4president</code>, GitHub: <code>poridge5president</code>, etc.), or they don&#x27;t match at all (Twitter: <code>porridge4president</code>, GitHub: <code>YouWontGuessThisOne</code>).</p>
<p>The problem that most likely arises from this technique is called <em>password chaos</em> (<a href="https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/password+chaos">Source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The confusion that arises when users have many unique passwords.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The aim of a password manager is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-password-manager-store-protect-yourself-hackers-lastpass-1password-dashlane-2017-2?r=DE&amp;IR=T">to solve this problem by storing all of your passwords in a single place and securing it with an <em>ultra secure superpassword!</em> (¬©)</a>. This way, you can use arbitrary passwords - preferebly gibberish that doesn&#x27;t make sense to humans (nor machines) - without losing them, as long as you have your <em>ultra secure superpassword!</em> (¬©) - aka your masterpassword. The benefits are obvious: You get rid of the password chaos problem while staying relatively secure. Eventhough password managers are quite benificial, some people (including myself) see a catch in them.</p>
<h2 id="relying-on-a-third-party">Relying on a third party</h2>
<p>Relying on third party companies doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal. After all, you are probably using some form of cloud service to host your photos. Yet there&#x27;s a lot of trust involved in letting others handle your private data, especially your passwords. In 2017, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/onelogin-hit-by-data-breached-exposing-sensitive-customer-data/">a major password manager got hacked, exposing sensitive data including users and their passwords</a>. This shows the potential for security breaches in an application that inherently seemed safe. But what if I told you that there is an alternative to this? A password manager that does not store your data at all?</p>
<h2 id="a-stateless-password-manager">A Stateless password manager</h2>
<p>Recently, I stumbled across <a href="https://lesspass.com/#/">LessPass</a>. LessPass is a password manager that is very different from what I have seen so far. Instead of storing passwords that either you or a random password generator came up with, it computes passwords on the fly, given a website, username, your masterpassword and some options.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/lesspass.gif" alt="LessPass"/></p>
<p>The key here is that LessPass uses a <strong>pure function</strong>, i.e. a function that given the same parameters will always give the same result. Using this technique, there&#x27;s no need to store your password in a database owned by a large company, nor do you have to sync your passwords between your devices (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lesspass.android&amp;hl=de">but there&#x27;s an app</a>). The computation happens right on your machine, and <strong>only</strong> on your machine. If you want to find out more about how it works under the hood, you can check out <a href="https://blog.lesspass.com/lesspass-how-it-works-dde742dd18a4#.vbgschksh">the authors blog post</a>. He goes into great detail on what alorithm is used to compute your passwords and how to utilize every feature of LessPass.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Being a little privacy nerd myself, I often think twice about what services I want to use, often even looking into self-hosted alternatives to major products. There are multiple products that offer self hosted solutions to store your passwords, however I also don&#x27;t even trust <em>myself</em> with such sensitive data either. LessPass eliminates the need to have a third party watch over your data, let alone to store it on their servers.</p><p class="horizontal-list"><button>üíåÔ∏è Reply via E-Mail</button><button>üîó Share</button><button>‚úèÔ∏è Fix Typo</button></p><hr/><h2>Continue Reading</h2><div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Mar 21 2023</time><br/><a href="/posts/2023-03-21-i-wont-buy-a-yubikey">I won&#x27;t buy a YubiKey</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Apr 07 2021</time><br/><a href="/posts/2021-04-07-pgp-guide">A pretty good guide to pretty good privacy</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Jan 07 2021</time><br/><a href="/posts/2021-01-07-delete-facebook">I closed my Facebook account, and you should too</a></div></div></div></article></div><footer class="footer"><div class="notice"><p>I invite you to read my new book<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/garrit/e/233695">Five Years of Blogging: Ideas, Opinions and Guides written 2019 to 2024</a>.
