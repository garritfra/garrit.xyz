I go. It&#x27;s small enough to fit in every pocket imaginable. It doesn&#x27;t need to
be recharged, it doesn&#x27;t care if it gets wet. It&#x27;s just right there whenever I
need it.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023-09-09-about-my-pocket-notebook/hike.jpeg" alt="My Notebook on a recent hike"/></p>
<p>As someone living with ADHD, I often find myself overwhelmed by random thoughts and environmental stimuli. Writing my thoughts down on pen and paper helps a lot in those moments, but until now, I&#x27;ve yet to come across a technique that stuck with me for an entire month. I take a lot of notes at work and I feel that it helps me stay organized, but I haven&#x27;t found a way to use the same technique in my free time. I once tried keeping a notebook in my backpack, but there are moments where I just don&#x27;t have my backpack with me, so I neglected it soon after I started.</p>
<p>That all changed when I stumbled across a video titled <a href="https://youtu.be/0xssCfBiUds?si=vxclEs1UxK5tlkL0">&quot;This pocket notebook is (slowly) replacing my phone&quot;</a>. It instantly clicked for me. Carrying a tiny notebook alongside my phone surely can&#x27;t be that hard. And indeed, it isn&#x27;t! At night, I put the notebook right next to my phone on my desk. After waking up, I grab my phone, and the notebook is right there for me to take as well. It&#x27;s become a habit to check if the notebook is there, just like checking your keys when leaving the house.</p>
<p>Phones are optimized to grab your attention whenever and wherever you are. After hours of mindless scrolling through various feeds, I feel like the phone has won the war over me and I begin to feel tired and overwhelmed. Having a notebook always with me, I now get a sense of control over where I&#x27;m allocating my attention. Instead of reaching for my phone, I might as well pull out the notebook and scribble whatever is on my mind in that moment. I get to choose what I&#x27;m writing down, instead of mindlessly consuming content I&#x27;m not even interested in.</p>
<p>In my current notebook, there are lists of things I did on some random day, ideas for side-projects, long paragraphs of unsorted thoughts, stamps I collected during a hike, and bad doodles of trees. It really doesn&#x27;t matter <strong>what</strong> I&#x27;m writing. It&#x27;s about bringing awareness to what&#x27;s on my mind.</p>
<h2 id="notebook-sizes">Notebook sizes</h2>
<p>I&#x27;m still playing around with different sizes of notebooks. So far, I&#x27;ve been using a <a href="https://www.moleskine.com/en-us/shop/notebooks/journals/volant-journals/volant-journals-forget-me-not-blue-and-amber-yellow-8058647620541.html">Moleskine Volant XS</a> notebook, which is 6.5 x 10 cm in size. It fits comfortably in the palm of my hand and easily slides in every pocket imaginable. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the perfect size for this purpose!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023-09-09-about-my-pocket-notebook/moleskine.jpeg" alt="My current notebook"/></p>
<p>As this notebook comes to an end (it took about a month to fill), I want to try out the slightly larger <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/original-kraft">Field Notes</a> notebook. It&#x27;s about 9 x 14 cm and <em>just barely</em> fits in my back pocket. My concern is that it&#x27;s too big to carry in tighter pockets, but from what I&#x27;ve read online so far, people seem to love this form factor. In my opinion Field Notes have a very unique vibe to them, and although the price is quite hefty (about 15‚Ç¨ for a pack of three, including shipping), they do make it up in style.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/posts/2023-09-09-about-my-pocket-notebook/field_notes.jpeg" alt="A Field Notes notebook"/></p>
<p>Field Notes also have awesome quarterly <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/limited-editions">limited editions</a> that give them an aspect of collectability (just look at their <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/national-parks">National Parks</a> series. They&#x27;re gorgeous! ü§§). There&#x27;s definetely a lot of hype around them, so if you don&#x27;t care about the aesthetics, you can always opt for way cheaper alternatives from your local stationary store (around 2‚Ç¨ or lower).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>After a month of carrying this notebook with me, I do feel that it increased my mental clarity quite a lot. I have a sense of control over my thoughts that I never had before. Whenever I&#x27;m sitting down with my notebook and a pen, I instantly notice things around me that I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed if I stared at my phone instead.</p>
<p>Notebooks and other so called &quot;EDC&quot; (everyday carry) items are a true rabbit hole (look it up, you&#x27;d be surprised), and its easy to get lost in the details. If you&#x27;re interested in trying this technique for yourself, just grab whatever tiny notebook you can find and <em>just write</em>.</p>
