Unfortunately, since I&#x27;m using a Mac for day to day work, I have to rely on a virtual machine to run anything Linux-related. VirtualBox doesn&#x27;t support the most recent kernels (5.9 is the most recent supported one), so there won&#x27;t be any cutting-edge development happening here. I decided to use ubuntu as my guest system, since it&#x27;s very easy to set up.</p>
<p>So, the first step is to get the sources. You could simply go ahead and download a specific release from <a href="https://kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>, but since I want to hack on it, I decided to go the git-route. Simply download the sources from <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/">their repo</a> and check out the tag you want to build.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: this might take a while. Their repository is huge! If you want to only need the <code>HEAD</code> and want to build on bare-metal (no VirtualBox), you could only clone the latest commit using <code>git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git --depth=1</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next up, you need to generate a <code>.config</code>. This file describes which features you want to compile into your kernel. To make a generic config that only compiles drivers for the hardware of your system, you can run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Copy the config of your current kernel into the repo
make oldconfig

# Only enable modules that are currently used by the system
make localmodconfig
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let&#x27;s get to actually compiling the kernel. In my case, I assigned 4 cores to my VM. The <code>-j</code> option tells make to run 4 jobs in parallel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Caution</strong>: Just providing -j will freeze your system, since make will try to launch an infinite amount of processes!</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>make -j4
</code></pre>
<p>Again, this might take some time. Go for a walk, get a coffee or watch your favorite TV-show. After compilation has finished, we need to install the kernel. To do so, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo make modules_install
sudo make install
</code></pre>
<p>In order to boot, we need to tell our bootloader about our new kernel. Run this command to update your grub config:</p>
<pre><code>sudo update-grub2
</code></pre>
<p>And voila! Your new kernel should be ready.</p>
<p>Reboot the system, and grub should pick up the new kernel and boot to it. If that&#x27;s not the case, you should be able to pick the kernel from the grub menu under <code>advanced options</code>.</p>
<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective</h2>
<p>I found that building my own kernel is a highly educational and fun experience. Using VirtualBox is a pain in the <code>/dev/null</code> to work with, since it has to add a lot of overhead to the system in order to work. You sometimes have to wait over 6 month until the support for a new kernel arrives. This problem should not apply if you compile on bare metal systems.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time!</p>
