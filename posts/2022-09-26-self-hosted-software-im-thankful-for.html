I used to self-host a lot of my tools, but after some time the burden of maintaining those tools made me switch to hosted alternatives.</p>
<p>However, there are a few projects that I stuck with over the years, and which I think deserve a deep appreciation.</p>
<h2 id="miniflux">Miniflux</h2>
<p><a href="https://miniflux.app/">Miniflux</a> is a very minimal, self-hostable RSS reader. It&#x27;s been rock-solid since they day I started using it. The data for the application entirely lives In a Postgres database, which makes migrating the application to new infrastructure setups an absolute breeze. I&#x27;ve been meaning to support the author for quite some time now, but the cost of maintaining an instance yourself is basically zero, so I&#x27;ve yet to find the time to switch to their paid hosted instance.</p>
<h2 id="plausible-analytics">Plausible Analytics</h2>
<p><a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a> is another tool that just keeps on running. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it whatsoever, and I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had to do a manual intervention. Just like Miniflux, there&#x27;s a paid instance, which supports the author, and just like Miniflux, the software is so good that I haven&#x27;t had a reason to switch to it yet. Oh, the irony.</p>
<h2 id="birdsitelive">BirdsiteLIVE</h2>
<p>While my instance of <a href="https://birdsite.slashdev.space/">BirdsiteLIVE</a> is currently in a bad shape, this is not at all the fault of the software. There are limitations to the amount of Twitter API requests you can make, and I did a poor job managing the users on that instance. It&#x27;s currently very overloaded and just very few tweets make it through. I will have to set aside some time to fix this, but the software itself has been rock solid since the day I started using it.</p>
<h2 id="synapse-(matrix)">Synapse (Matrix)</h2>
<p>I was hesitant to mention <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> on this list. I had my ups and downs with Synapse (their Python implementation of a Matrix server), but the fact that my instance is still running after multiple infrastructure transitions and even a migration from SQLite to Postgres says something about the quality of the software. I have a feeling that Synapse is fairly resource-hungry, but if you feed it with enough RAM and disk, it will keep running indefinitely.</p>
<h2 id="homeassistant">Homeassistant</h2>
<p>You can throw <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Homeassistant</a> on a Raspberry Pi and everything works out of the gate. I even migrated my instance from a RPi 3 to a RPi 4 via their backup and restore functionality. It&#x27;s absolutely flawless.</p>
<h2 id="dead-projects">Dead projects</h2>
<p>I think it&#x27;s fair to also mention the software that I no longer self-host.</p>
<h3 id="e-mail">E-Mail</h3>
<p>Just don&#x27;t roll your own email.</p>
<h3 id="mastodon">Mastodon</h3>
<p>Too power hungry for my taste. No easy way to host inside docker, which made it a pain to keep running. I&#x27;m very happy with <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">Fosstodon</a>, and don&#x27;t see a reason to switch to a self-hosted instance any time soon.</p>
<h3 id="freshrss">FreshRSS</h3>
<p>I tried replacing Miniflux once, but failed. Nothing beats Miniflux.</p>
<h3 id="prometheus-+-grafana">Prometheus + Grafana</h3>
<p>Monitoring <strong><em>inside</em></strong> your infra works until the infra goes down, at which point you&#x27;re essentially driving blindfolded. I switched to Grafana Cloud, which includes a very generous free tier.</p>
