It describes all the AI generated images and texts we see on the internet. I&#x27;d like to propose a term that basically describes reverse AI Slop: <strong>Mental AI Fog</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of <em>consuming</em> too much AI generated content (which also applies), AI Fog describes the inability to <em>produce</em> content without the help of AI. We&#x27;re surrounded by flowery written articles and resources that we think that it&#x27;s not worth it to put in the effort to write a text ourselves. This is comparable to how computer keyboards, spellchecking and autocorrection have rendered my generation and the ones to come incapable of comfortably writing longform text.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m currently strongly suffering from AI fog. I&#x27;m so used to letting some LLM flesh out a quick and dirty prompt nowadays that it&#x27;s hard for me to write this text, get the point across and not feel insecure about my style of writing. This site is supposed to be a way to persist my thoughts whenever I want to, but are they still <em>my</em> thoughts if they have been proofread and corrected by a computer?</p>
<p>As a result, all these thoughts are piling up in my head. Where I previously braindumped thoughts on a piece of paper, I now only come up with a couple of words and let the AI elaborate. <strong>I&#x27;m consuming what are supposed to be my own thoughts</strong>, which perpetuates the cycle.</p>
<p>This needs to stop. I need to get back <strong>creating</strong> things myself. I decided to abandon the use of LLMs for most content on this site. And where AI has been used, it will be clearly mentioned. I&#x27;m contemplating adding some sort of &quot;Backed by AI&quot; label for certain pages to make it harder for myself to fall back to a helping hand. I will likely still be using LLMs, but making it obvious will force me to mindfully choose where it will be used.</p>
<p>Is this something you can relate to? Is AI fog even a fitting term for this? I don&#x27;t know. And if it isn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s okay because I came up with it myself.</p><p class="horizontal-list"><button>üíåÔ∏è Reply via E-Mail</button><button>üîó Share</button><button>‚úèÔ∏è Fix Typo</button></p><hr/><h2>Continue Reading</h2><div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Sep 15 2025</time><br/><a href="/posts/2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free">Making family IT support effortless (and free)</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">May 20 2025</time><br/><a href="/posts/2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb">No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Feb 27 2025</time><br/><a href="/posts/2025-02-27-a-trick-to-manage-frequently-used-prompts-in-claude-chatgpt">A trick to manage frequently used prompts in Claude/ChatGPT</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Dec 29 2024</time><br/><a href="/posts/2024-12-29-2024-in-review">2024 in Review</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Aug 31 2024</time><br/><a href="/posts/2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models">Sentiment analysis using ML models</a></div></div></div></article></div><footer class="footer"><div class="notice"><p>I invite you to read my new book<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/garrit/e/233695">Five Years of Blogging: Ideas, Opinions and Guides written 2019 to 2024</a>.
