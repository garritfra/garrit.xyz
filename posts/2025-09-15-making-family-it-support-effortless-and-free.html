Debugging that through the telephone is just not happening.</p>
<p>I always stayed away from TeamViewer, because I was never really sure if that had a free plan, and the possibility of finding out mid-session that they don&#x27;t have one was reason enough to save the hassle of yelling the installation instructions through the phone.</p>
<p>I remember hearing about <a href="https://rustdesk.com/">RustDesk</a> in a podcast a couple of years ago. The host claimed it to be a hassle-free open source replacement for TeamViewer, but by the time the next IT-support session arrived, I already forgot about it. Until yesterday!</p>
<p>Yesterday, I just didn&#x27;t get enough information to be useful. I just needed a way to remotely access the computer, and that&#x27;s then I remembered the promise of RustDesk. Going in blind, I quickly installed the client on my laptop and sent a mail with the instructions to my family member:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click here (a download link to the executable file)</li>
<li>Press the windows key</li>
<li>Type &quot;rust&quot; (to search for the file)</li>
<li>Press enter</li>
<li>Tell me the ID and the onetime password on the screen</li>
</ol>
<p>These instructions are fool-proof! And sure enough, they worked. I logged in and debugged the issue. No paywall, no corporate bullsh**, just a simple client that just works as intended out of the box. I was delighted to see that the plan has worked out. Going forward, Rustdesk will be my primary choice for remote IT support.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re interested: for some reason the browser window on their screen was resized to a tiny box near the edge of the screen, so whenever they clicked a bookmarked link on their desktop, instead of &quot;nothing happening&quot;, they just didn&#x27;t see the page opening in the browser.</p>
