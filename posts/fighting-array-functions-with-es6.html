At a basic level, I wanted to pass part of an array to a function, but wanted to use the original array later on.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let something = arr.splice(0, 3)
do(something) // []
DoSomethingWithOriginal(arr)
</code></pre>
<p>Thinking that Array.prototype functions don’t mutate the array directly, I moved on with my day. This lead to a bunch of problems down the line.
Some array methods in the EcmaScript specification are designed to mutate arrays, while others do not.</p>
<h3 id="non-mutating-functions" level="3">Non-mutating functions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Array.prototype.map()</li>
<li>Array.prototype.slice()</li>
<li>Array.prototype.join()</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>These functions do not mutate the array they are called on. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let partOfArr = arr.slice(1, 2);
console.log(partOfArr); // [2, 3]
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="mutating-functions" level="3">Mutating functions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Array.prototype.sort()</li>
<li>Array.prototype.splice()</li>
<li>Array.prototype.reverse()</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods mutate the array directly. This can lead to unreadable code, as the value can be manipulated from anywhere. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">let arr = [5, 2, 4];
arr.sort();
console.log(arr); // [2, 4, 5]
</code></pre>
<p>To me, it is very unclear, which functions do, and which don’t mutate arrays directly. But, there’s a simple trick you can use to stop letting the functions mutate arrays directly, ultimately leading to more readable and reliable code.</p>

<p>Take a look at this snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">let arr = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4];
let sorted = [...arr].sort();
console.log(arr); // [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]
console.log(sorted); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>
<p>Voilà! We have a sorted array, and the original one is also around. The spread operator(<code>[...arr]</code>) is used to create a new array with every value of arr .
You can use this for arrays, as well as objects:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">let obj = {
	field: &quot;example&quot;,
};
let extendedObj = {
	...obj,
	anotherField: 42,
};
console.log(extendedObj.field); // &quot;example&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>ES6 brought us awesome features like let and const assignments, as well as arrow functions. A more unknown feature however is the spread operator. I hope you now know how to use the spread operator, and that you can adopt it for cleaner and simpler code.</p><hr/><p><a href="mailto:garrit@slashdev.space?subject=Re: Fighting%20Array%20Functions%20with%20ES6">Reply via E-Mail</a></p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/garrit" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.buymeacoffee.com/button-api/?text=Buy me a coffee&amp;emoji=&amp;slug=garrit&amp;button_colour=FFDD00&amp;font_colour=000000&amp;font_family=Cookie&amp;outline_colour=000000&amp;coffee_colour=ffffff"/></a><p class="page__tag-list"><svg class="page__tag-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 0 1-2.83 0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 0 1 0 2.82z"></path><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"></line></svg><a href="/posts?tags=javascript">#<!-- -->javascript</a><a href="/posts?tags=guide">#<!-- -->guide</a><a href="/posts?tags=programming">#<!-- -->programming</a><a href="/posts?tags=web">#<!-- -->web</a></p><div class="shareon"><a class="facebook"></a><a class="linkedin"></a><a class="mastodon"></a><a class="pocket"></a><a class="reddit"></a><a class="telegram"></a><a class="twitter"></a><a class="whatsapp"></a></div><hr/><h2>Continue Reading</h2><div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Jun 01 2023</time><br/><a href="/posts/2023-06-01-single-page-applications-on-github-pages">Single Page Applications on GitHub Pages</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Apr 27 2023</time><br/><a href="/posts/2023-04-27-migrating-homeassistant-from-sd-to-ssd">Migrating Homeassistant from SD to SSD</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Apr 12 2023</time><br/><a href="/posts/2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme">Instant dark theme</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Mar 30 2023</time><br/><a href="/posts/2023-03-30-designing-resilient-cloud-infrastructure">Designing resilient cloud infrastructure</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Mar 23 2023</time><br/><a href="/posts/2023-03-23-fullscreen-terminals-in-vscode">Fullscreen Terminals in VSCode</a></div></div></div></article></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><h3>Links of Interest</h3><a href="/rss.xml">RSS Feed</a><br/><a href="/todo">Todo List</a><br/><a href="https://keyoxide.org/hkp/garrit@slashdev.space">PGP Key</a><br/><a href="/guestbook">Guestbook</a><br/><a href="/blogroll">Blogroll</a><br/><a href="/ctf">Capture the Flag</a><h3>Elsewhere</h3><a href="https://github.com/garritfra" rel="me">Github</a><br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garritfranke/">LinkedIn</a><br/><a href="https://fosstodon.org/@garritfra">Mastodon (ActivityPub)</a><br/><a href="/contact">Contact</a></div><p>👻 Proud member of <a target="_blank" href="https://darktheme.club/">darktheme.club</a> <!-- -->👻</p><p>© 2018-<!-- -->2023<!-- --> Garrit Franke<br/><a href="/privacy">Privacy</a> |<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz">Source Code</a></p></footer></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"fighting-array-functions-with-es6","markdownBody":"\nYesterday, I came across an interesting bug regarding JavaScript Arrays, and I wanted to share my approach to fixing it.\nAt a basic level, I wanted to pass part of an array to a function, but wanted to use the original array later on.\n\n```js\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlet something = arr.splice(0, 3)\ndo(something) // []\nDoSomethingWithOriginal(arr)\n```\n\nThinking that Array.prototype functions don’t mutate the array directly, I moved on with my day.

This means that if you try to fetch a document that's *not* the index, for example `/foo`, the server will try to load the file with that name. \n\nBy nature, SPAs only consist of a single HTML entry point (`index.html` in most cases). It's responsible for routing the user to the correct page if there are multiple paths. And here's the crux: if the user tries to load `/foo`, he will not land at the SPA entry point. Instead, he will see a `404` error.\n\n## The solution\n\nA `404` response will automatically return a file called `404.html`, which we can use to our advantage. After building the application, simply copy the `index.html` to `404.html`, as demonstrated by [this commit](https://github.com/garritfra/sendpasswords.net/commit/66bdb68c229a3ac3386f7816a746155e658eb586). This will use `index.html` to serve the application on the root level, and `404.html` to load *the same app* if the page doesn't exist as a file. Whether the `index.html` is needed if there's already a `404.html` is up to you. I left it in to make clear that this is just a workaround.\n\nThis is a [well known](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69308662/9046809) workaround, but I wanted to bring some extra awareness to it, since it's a problem I ran into a couple of times so far.

Create and download a full backup through the UI\r\n2. Flash Homeassistant onto the SSD\r\n3. Remove the SD card and plug the SSD into a USB 3.0 port of the Pi\r\n4. Boot\r\n5.

The speed has improved A LOT, and everything was set up as it should be. \r\n\r\n...Until we turned on the lights in the livingroom. My ZigBee-dongle, plugged into another USB port, wasn't able to communicate with the devices on the network.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging around, I came across several threads stating that an SSD over USB 3.0 apparently creates a lot of interference to surrounding hardware, including my ZigBee dongle. The fix was simple: either get an extension port for the dongle, or plug the SSD into a USB 2.0 port of the Pi. Since I didn't have an extension cord to get the dongle far away enough from the SSD, I went with the latter option for now. And that fixed it! The performance was much worse, but still better than the SD I used before. My next step will be to grab an extension cord from my parents. I'm sure they won't mind.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 066 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating Homeassistant from SD to SSD","date":"2023-04-27","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, homeassistant, homelab"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","homeassistant","homelab"]},{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","markdownBody":"\nThanks to [Jacksons](https://jacksonchen666.com/) [update to darktheme.club](https://github.com/garritfra/darktheme.club/pull/79), I just came across a neat little [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) that turns a mostly CSS-free document into a pleasantly dark site:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  color-scheme: light dark;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will adjust all elements on the page to the color scheme preferred by the user - without any other custom styles! 🤯 It is also [widely supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_color-scheme) by browsers.\r\n\r\nI've always been quite dependent on CSS-frameworks for any project I'm starting.

During the development, I learned a lot about designing components to be resilient and scalable. Here are some key takeaways.\r\n\r\nOne of the most critical components of a resilient infrastructure is redundancy. On AWS, you place your components inside a \"region\". This could be `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt) or `us-east-1` (North Virgina), etc. To further reduce the risk of an outage, each region is divided into multiple [Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html) (AZs). The AZs of a region are usually located some distance apart from each other. In case of a flood, a fire or a bomb detonating near one AZ, the other AZs should in most cases still be intact. You should have at least two, preferably three replicas of each component across multiple availability zones in a region. By having replicas of your components in different availability zones, you reduce the risk of downtime caused by an outage in a single availability zone.\r\n\r\nAnother way to ensure scalability and resilience for your database is to use [Aurora Serverless v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.html). This database service is specifically designed for scalable, on-demand, and cost-effective performance. The database scales itself up or down based on the workload, which allows you to automatically and dynamically adjust the database capacity to meet the demand of your application, ensuring that your application is responsive and performs well without the need for manual intervention. Adding Serverless instances to an existing RDS cluster is also a seemless proccess.\r\n\r\nIn addition to switching to Aurora Serverless v2, using read replicas for cache and database in a separate availability zone can act as a hot standby without extra configuration. Keep in mind that read replicas are only utilized by explicitly using the read-only endpoint of a cluster. But even if you're only using the \"main\" cluster endpoint (and therefore just the primary instance), a read replica can promote itself to the primary instance in case of a fail over, which drastically reduces downtime.\r\n\r\nWhen using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), use Fargate as opposed to EC2 instances. Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows you to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. It smartly locates instances across availability zones, ensuring that your application is always available.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, you should always ensure that there are more than one instance of a component in your infrastructure. There are also services on AWS that abstract away the physical infrastructure (Fargate, S3, Lambda) and use a multi-AZ pattern by default.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 061 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Designing resilient cloud infrastructure","date":"2023-03-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, guide, note, learnings"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","guide","note","learnings"]},{"slug":"2023-03-23-fullscreen-terminals-in-vscode","markdownBody":"\nI often find myself using a \"real\" terminal alongside my VSCode setup, because for some tasks the built-in terminal, due to its small size, is quite flimsy to use. *But*!
