These last couple of days, I&#x27;ve been sprinting towards the finish line with one post every day to finish the challenge until the end of the year. And I finally made it!</p>
<p>I started this challenge with <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2021-01-11-100daystooffload">this</a> post on January 11th, 2021, which means it took me almost three full years to finish it. The original challenge was to write 100 posts in <strong>one</strong> year, so I&#x27;m way overdue. 😅 But that doesn&#x27;t make me less proud to finish it!</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re interested, you can find the list of all 100 of my posts <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts?tags=100DaysToOffload">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
<p>Before starting this challenge, I sometimes struggled with putting out content on this blog. It felt like each post had to be perfect, and if it wasn&#x27;t, I was scared to publish it.</p>
<p>The idea of #100DaysToOffload is to let go of this fear and <em>Just. Write.</em> This absolutely worked. I accepted the fact that not every post is perfect and <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-04-01-quality-vs.-quantity">sometimes posting more often with worse quality makes way for better posts</a>.</p>
<p>In order to post more often, I also found ways to reduce the friction between me writing a text and publishing it to the blog. I&#x27;ve yet to cover this in a post, but I built myself <a href="https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish_via_issue.yaml">a handy script</a> that turns the contents of a GitHub issue into a pull request, ready to be merged as a blog post. This enables me to write posts everywhere I want (like the one right now, which is written on my phone), instead of having to open my laptop, create a new file, write the post and commit it to the repository.</p>
<h2 id="what&#x27;s-next?">What&#x27;s next?</h2>
<p>I will continue posting when I feel like it! I set myself the goal to publish at least 50 posts a year, but that&#x27;s just a rough estimate. If I don&#x27;t feel like blogging, I won&#x27;t force myself to do it.</p>
<p>All in all, I&#x27;m very thankful for having taken part in this challenge. I met <a href="https://kevquirk.com/">a</a> <a href="https://joelchrono.xyz/">bunch</a> <a href="https://claytonerrington.com/">of</a> <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/">like-minded</a> <a href="https://jlelse.blog/">folks</a> that are happy to discuss whatever I&#x27;m rambling about, and it&#x27;s great to read whatever they are rambling about as well! I&#x27;m also thankful for all the nuggets of information I got to share with you, and also with my future self (seriously, you won&#x27;t believe how often I&#x27;m looking up old posts and being happy that I wrote that down!).</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, until next time!</p>
