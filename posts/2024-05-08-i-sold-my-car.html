And on the weekend, you <strong>really</strong> had to plan ahead. Living without a car was almost unthinkable.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/posts/2024-05-08-i-sold-my-car/my-car.jpeg" alt="My car"/></p>
<p>After moving to the city in 2020, I found that I used my car less and less. My commute to work was easier with the bike (if I wasn&#x27;t working from home), and for anything else, busses and trams were the way to go. The occasional family visit was the only excuse to use my car.</p>
<p>Owning a car doesn&#x27;t &quot;feel&quot; expensive. Sure, gas is expensive, but simply owning one doesn&#x27;t feel like a huge burden on your wallet. Just to get a rough estimate, I jotted down all running costs.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/posts/2024-05-08-i-sold-my-car/running-costs.jpeg" alt="Running costs"/></p>
<p>My car costs <strong>over 1000‚Ç¨ per year</strong>, or about 85‚Ç¨ per month, just to be moved about twice a month! So, a few weeks ago, I decided to sell it.</p>
<p>I created a posting on <a href="https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/">Kleinanzeigen</a> (a german descendant of - and previously owned by - eBay), and after about two weeks, the car had a new owner. I hope that it&#x27;s in better hands now and lives on to be a happy and frequently used car.</p>
<p>Going forward, I&#x27;m not worried about my mobility at all. My partner still owns her car and has the option to take the bus to work. So, if we&#x27;re not on the road together, I can always fall back to using her car. And if she needs her car and I&#x27;m desperate to go somewhere afar, there&#x27;s also multiple ride-sharing options available in my town. They are a bit expensive to use, but spending 40‚Ç¨ for a day trip to my family every two months is still way less than paying 85‚Ç¨ a month for a car that&#x27;s sitting there idle.</p><p class="horizontal-list"><button>üíåÔ∏è Reply via E-Mail</button><button>üîó Share</button><button>‚úèÔ∏è Fix Typo</button></p><hr/><h2>Continue Reading</h2><div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Sep 15 2025</time><br/><a href="/posts/2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free">Making family IT support effortless (and free)</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">May 20 2025</time><br/><a href="/posts/2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb">No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Dec 29 2024</time><br/><a href="/posts/2024-12-29-2024-in-review">2024 in Review</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">Sep 01 2024</time><br/><a href="/posts/2024-09-01-AI-fog">Mental AI Fog and how to cure it</a></div><div class="blog__list__post"><time class="blog__list__post__date">May 10 2024</time><br/><a href="/posts/2024-05-10-about-my-smart-g-shock">About my &#x27;smart&#x27; G-Shock</a></div></div></div></article></div><footer class="footer"><div class="notice"><p>I invite you to read my new book<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/garrit/e/233695">Five Years of Blogging: Ideas, Opinions and Guides written 2019 to 2024</a>.
