So much has happened! I haven&#x27;t been very active on this blog lately, mainly because I&#x27;ve been super busy in other areas of life.</p>
<p>The biggest change for me this year is one that I can cross off of my <a href="/impossible">impossible list</a>: We bought a house! I&#x27;ve been wanting to write post about this for a few weeks, and now that things are settling in, I might have the time to do that. In short: We moved from Brunswick (Germany) back to a more rural town just outside Brunswick. It&#x27;s closer to my girlfriends workplace, closer to my family and overall way cheaper than properties in Brunswick. We&#x27;re super happy about the house and have yet to find any major annoyances. The neighbors are nice, and the community is incredibly wholesome.</p>
<p>As for other personal projects, there hasn‚Äôt been as much traction as there used to be. My interests have partially shifted to hobbies that don‚Äôt involve a computer, which I‚Äôm grateful for. I still love building software projects ‚Äì especially now that it‚Äôs become so easy to get started with a project using an AI brainstorming companion ‚Äì I just do it less often. I picked up running as a hobby (more on that later), gather with friends to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons and work on stuff in my new basement.</p>
<h2 id="goal-results">Goal Results</h2>
<p>These are the goals <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-12-30-2023-in-review">I set myself for 2024</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a side project that generated at least 100‚Ç¨ of value</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That‚Äôs a bust. As mentioned, I haven‚Äôt really spent a lot of time building side projects. And the ones I did build, I consider tools rather than an income stream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get a scuba diving license</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm a certified PADI Open Water Diver! You can see some impressions <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2024-02-26-dive-log-phuket">here</a> and <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2024-03-12-dive-log-vietnam">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do a 10 km run (I really need to start moving again)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ran three 10k runs this year. <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/11416831567">The first in May</a>, then in <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/11768631707">June</a> and finally, <a href="https://strava.app.link/P0Ulu4L1IPb">in September</a>, I improved my 2018 personal best by a few minutes!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sell my car</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check. More infos <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2024-05-08-i-sold-my-car">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write at least 50 blog posts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn‚Äôt reach this goal, but I‚Äôm also not disappointed by it. <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-04-01-quality-vs.-quantity">The frequency of my posts varies</a>, and this year it was just lower than before.</p>
<h2 id="2025-goals">2025 Goals</h2>
<p>Here are some new goals for this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a side project that generated at least 100‚Ç¨ of value (I‚Äôm keeping this goal until I reach it!)</li>
<li>Run a half marathon (and optionally <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/985747064">beat my PB</a>)</li>
<li>Learn woodworking and build something that takes at least 3 days to complete</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prediction-results">Prediction Results</h2>
<p>The results for <a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-12-30-2023-in-review">last years predictions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin will at last reach a value of 100,000$, following the<a href="https://www.nicehash.com/countdown/btc-halving-2024-05-10-12-00"> halving</a> likely happening in 2024</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/bitcoin-100000-rcna181008">Bitcoin did reach 100,000$</a>, though not following the halving event. Still, I‚Äôd call this a pass!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SpaceX will use a <a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/">Starship</a> prototype to launch Starlink satellites into orbit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope, they didn‚Äôt. But they made incredible leaps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tesla cars a still not fully self driving (<a href="https://motherfrunker.ca/fsd/">reference</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They claim to launch it in Europe <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/09/05/tesla-says-full-self-driving-car-expected-in-europe-early-next-year-pending-regulatory-app">earlier next year</a>. It‚Äôs currently in closed testing. Still, I wouldn‚Äôt give it a pass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google will replace their main search with an AI chat bot (see<a href="https://bard.google.com/"> Bard</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure if I‚Äôd call Gemini a full replacement, but it does have a wrapper around their traditional search engine. The product is shit compared to Anthropic and OpenAI, but I would call this a pass, since you can use Gemini instead of Google Search.</p>
<h2 id="2025-predictions">2025 Predictions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Apple will not ship a successor to the Apple Vision Pro</li>
<li>At least one country will mandate AI watermarking for all AI-generated content used in commercial applications</li>
<li>Russia and Ukraine will come to a consensus and end the war. Ukraine will have lost territory</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#x27;s a wrap.
