In reality, this checklist is very hard to fulfill, but it's a nice reminder of what a well thought out requirement could look like.\r\n\r\n### Scope\r\n\r\n- Is the feature meant to be very polished and finished or are we just trying to get user feedback as an MVP?\r\n- If we are running a MVP, is the current feature a true MVP? How can we simplify or cut scope?\r\n\r\n### Eligibility\r\n\r\n- What populations should be included or excluded from the experiment? When should users see this feature? (Which pages, signed in/signed out, mobile, desktop, etc.)\r\nWhere/when should bucketing occur?\r\n- Will the experiment conflict with any other experiments? Do the experiments need to run exclusively?\r\n- What countries should the experiment run in (can impact translations)?\r\n\r\n### A11Y\r\n\r\n- Is there any special accessibility work this feature will require? If extra work is anticipated, check in early with our a11y team.\r\n- When testing and developing we should keep two users in mind - a keyboard user and a voice over user, do we need to add other code for these users?\r\n\r\n### Translations\r\n\r\n- Are there any strings to be translated that should be submitted ASAP?\r\n- Do we need to translate any labels for a11y?\r\n\r\n### Observability\r\n\r\n- How will we know that the feature is working? Are there existing graphs we can use or do we need new ones?\r\n- Should any of these metrics have a threshold or alerting?\r\n- Are we missing any key events to obtain user feedback?\r\n- How will we compare our control and variant?\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n- Is there anything in my experiment that could degrade performance of the site?\r\n- Do I need an operational experiment to verify that I’m not impacting performance?\r\n\r\n### Error States\r\n\r\n- Do we have designs for loading states?\r\n- Do we have designs for unsuccessful requests and error handling?\r\n- Do we have informative logging when there are errors?\r\n\r\n### QA\r\n\r\n- What set of browsers and devices should we test our new feature against?\r\n- Which user perspectives do we need to test?\r\n\r\n### Ramping\r\n\r\n- What will our ramping strategy be?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck out the [original post](https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/a-checklist-manifetsy) for a full writeup and the intentions behind this checklist.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 056 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"A software requirements checklist","date":"2023-03-11","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, quote, practices"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","quote","practices"]},{"slug":"2023-03-10-debugging-ecs-tasks","markdownBody":"\r\nI just had to debug an application on AWS ECS. The whole procedure is documented in more detail in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-exec.html), but I think it's beneficial (both for my future self and hopefully to someone out there) to write down the proccess in my own words.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you need access to the cluster via the [CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/de/cli/). In addition to the CLI, you need the [AWS Session Manager plugin for the CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html). If you're on MacOS, you can install that via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/session-manager-plugin):\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew install --cask session-manager-plugin\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, you need to allow the task you want to debug to be able to execute commands. Since I'm using Terraform, this was just a matter of adding the [`enable_execute_command`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ecs_service#enable_execute_command) attribute to the service:\r\n\r\n```tf\r\nresource \"aws_ecs_service\" \"my_service\" {\r\n  name            = \"my-service\"\r\n  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.my_cluster.id\r\n  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.my_task_definition.id\r\n  desired_count   = var.app_count\r\n  launch_type     = \"FARGATE\"\r\n  enable_execute_command = true # TODO: Disable after debugging\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may also need specify an execution role in the task definition:\r\n\r\n```tf\r\nresource \"aws_ecs_task_definition\" \"my_task_definition\" {\r\n  family              = \"my-task\"\r\n  task_role_arn       = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_execution_role.arn\r\n  execution_role_arn  = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_execution_role.arn  # <-- Add this\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure that this role has the correct access rights. There's a nice [troubleshooting guide](https://aws.amazon.com/de/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ecs-error-execute-command/) going over the required permissions.\r\n\r\nIf you had to do some modifications, make sure to roll out a new deployment with the fresh settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\naws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service my-service --force-new-deployment\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, you should be able to issue commands against any running container!\r\n\r\n```\r\naws ecs execute-command --cluster westfalen --task <task-id-or-arn> --container my-container --interactive --command=\"/bin/sh\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 055 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Debugging ECS Tasks","date":"2023-03-10","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, aws, guide, note, terraform"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","aws","guide","note","terraform"]},{"slug":"2023-03-08-terraform-and-kubernetes-are-fundamentally-different","markdownBody":"\r\nOn the surface, Infrastructure as Code tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) or [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/de/cloudformation/) may seem to behave similar to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) YAMLs, but they are in fact fundamentally different approaches to cloud infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTerraform tries to provide a declarative way to express imperative actions. If you tell Terraform that you need an EC2 instance, it will notice that no such resource exists and instruct the AWS API to create one. If you don't need the instance anymore and remove the resource definition from your code, Terraform will also pick that up and instruct the AWS API to delete the instance. This works well in most cases, but every once in a while the declarative state may get out of sync with the real world, resulting in errors that are hard to debug and resolve.\r\n\r\nKubernetes on the other hand is a fully declarative system. In a [previous post](/posts/2022-09-22-kubernetes-is-a-domain-specific-database) I touched on how Kubernetes constantly compares the *desired* state with the *actual* state of the resources and tries to match the two. Although it is theoretically possible to issue imperative actions, Kubernetes is built from the ground up to be declarative.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 054 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The fundamental difference between Terraform and Kubernetes","date":"2023-03-08","tags":"note, infrastructure, terraform, kubernetes, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["note","infrastructure","terraform","kubernetes","100DaysToOffload"]},{"slug":"2023-03-04-pods-vs.-containers","markdownBody":"\r\nIn Kubernetes, pods and containers are often confused. I found a [great article](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-vs-pods/) going over the differences of the two terms.\r\n\r\n> Containers and Pods are alike. Under the hood, they heavily rely on Linux namespaces and cgroups. However, Pods aren't just groups of containers. A Pod is a self-sufficient higher-level construct. All pod's containers run on the same machine (cluster node), their lifecycle is synchronized, and mutual isolation is weakened to simplify the inter-container communication. This makes Pods much closer to traditional VMs, [bringing back the familiar deployment patterns like sidecar or reverse proxy](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/multi-container-pods-and-container-communication-in-kubernetes/).\r\n\r\nIn my own words: Containers are made up of Linux namespaces and cgroups. Pods can be thought of as a cgroup of cgroups (though not really), mimicing the behavior of a virtual machine that runs multiple containers with a synchronized lifecycle. The containers in a pod are losely isolated, making it easy to communicate between each other. Containers in a pod can however set individual resource requests, enabled by Linux namespaces.\r\n\r\nI'd highly encourage you to check out [the original article](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-vs-pods/) if you want to learn more about this topic.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 053 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Pods vs. Containers","date":"2023-03-04","tags":"note, kubernetes, infrastructure, docker, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["note","kubernetes","infrastructure","docker","100DaysToOffload"]},{"slug":"2023-03-03-notes-on-containerizing-php-applications","markdownBody":"\r\nI was recently tasked with building a rudimentary infrastructure for a PHP application. Coming from a Node.js-driven world where every human and their grandmother has a blog post about containerizing your application, it was very interesting to see where PHP differs to other applications.\r\n\r\nOne major gotcha for me was that PHP code is executed on **request-time**, meaning a new process is spawned for each incoming request. Most other languages have dedicated runtimes that handle incoming requests. This unique approach is very flexible and scalable, but it comes with the implication that there is a **separate webserver** that calls into the PHP interpreter when it needs to.\r\n\r\nIn Node.js (and most other languages), you can \"just run the app\", as demonstrated by this Dockerfile:\r\n\r\n```dockerfile\r\nFROM node:18.14.2-alpine3.17 AS build\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\r\n\r\nCOPY package*.json ./\r\n\r\nRUN npm ci\r\n\r\nCOPY . .\r\n\r\nEXPOSE 3000\r\n\r\nCMD [ \"node\", \"server.js\" ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPHP on the other side is rarely used on its own. Most of the time, it needs a webserver alongside it:\r\n\r\n```dockerfile\r\nFROM php:8.1-apache-bullseye\r\n\r\n# <snip>\r\n\r\nCOPY . /var/www/html\r\nWORKDIR /var/www/html\r\n\r\n# <snip>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I'm using the official PHP docker image. The PHP maintainers know that adding a webserver alongside PHP is a very common pattern, so most of the variants of the image ship with a webserver. In this example I'm using Apache, but we might as well use NGINX or some other webserver. There's also the option to use [FPM](https://www.php.net/manual/de/install.fpm.php) as a FastCGI implementation and a webserver in a **separate** container.\r\n\r\nGrasping this took me some time, but after it clicked it made many things a lot clearer.\r\n\r\n## More complete Dockerfile example\r\n\r\nThe Dockerfile above is meant to demonstrate how PHP applications differ from other languages. The following is a more complete example you can use to containerize your PHP application. In this case it’s a Laravel app, so your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\n```dockerfile\r\nFROM php:8.1-apache-bullseye\r\n\r\nRUN apt-get clean && \\\r\n    apt-get update && \\\r\n    apt-get install --fix-missing -y \\\r\n        zip && \\\r\n    docker-php-ext-install \\\r\n        pdo \\\r\n        pdo_mysql \\\r\n        bcmath\r\n\r\nCOPY --from=composer:2 /usr/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer\r\n\r\nCOPY . /var/www/html\r\nWORKDIR /var/www/html\r\n\r\nENV APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT /var/www/html/public\r\n\r\nRUN composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --no-interaction && \\\r\n    sed -ri -e 's!/var/www/html!${APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT}!g' /etc/apache2/sites-available/*.conf && \\\r\n    sed -ri -e 's!/var/www/!${APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT}!g' /etc/apache2/apache2.conf /etc/apache2/conf-available/*.conf && \\\r\n    php artisan config:cache && \\\r\n    php artisan view:cache && \\\r\n    php artisan route:cache && \\\r\n    php artisan storage:link && \\\r\n    chmod 777 -R /var/www/html/storage/ && \\\r\n    chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/ && \\\r\n    a2enmod rewrite\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is post 052 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on containerizing PHP applications","date":"2023-03-03","tags":"note, infrastructure, docker, php, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["note","infrastructure","docker","php","100DaysToOffload"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
