{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2021-08-08-fun-with-pen-and-paper-race-cars","markdownBody":"\nI recently came across some fun games that can be played using nothing but a\npen and some paper. One of those games was called \"Race Cars\" and I wondered\nhow on earth you would play a racing game on paper, and the answer is: simple\nmath!\n\n## The core idea\n\nThe goal of the game is to cross the finish line of a hand-drawn race track\nfirst without hitting the edge. Race cars have a velocity that can be adjusted\neach move. If you're too greedy, you will crash. If you hit the breaks too\nearly, another player will win.\n\n## How it's played\n\nWe start out with a hand-drawn race track. The shape really can be anything you\nlike. Just be creative!\n\n![A race track on paper](/assets/paperracer/0.jpg)\n\nNext, each player makes a cross on the starting line. This resembles the\nplayers racecar. Right now, none of the cars is moving. They have a velocity of\n0 on the x axis and 0 on the y axis.\n\n![Two crosses on the starting line](/assets/paperracer/1.jpg)\n\nEach move, a player can accelerate or decelerate his vehicle by 1 on any axis.\nThe first move of each player is somewhat obvious. They want to accelerate\nstraight forward. On our race track, that means accelerate by 1 on the y axis.\n\n![A race car made a move](/assets/paperracer/2.jpg)\n\nNext, we can either keep on accelerating like the red player does, or \"turn\"\nour vehicle left by changing our y velocity from 0 to -1, which gives us a\nvelocity of -1, 1.\n\n![Paper race cars after two moves](/assets/paperracer/3.jpg)\n\nOn a long stretch, the red player wants to overtake blue by keeping his foot on\nthe paddle. Blue on the other hand plays it safe and hits the breaks.\n\n![Paper race cars on a long stretch](/assets/paperracer/4.jpg)\n\nSoon after, red realizes his mistake. Being so busy trying to turn, he's unable\nto hit the breaks. A crash is inevitable. Blue however continues to take the\nturn nice and slow. His humble mind brought him victory!\n\n![The red player right before crashing into a wall](/assets/paperracer/5.jpg)\n\n## It's all about fun\n\nThe concept of this game is very flexible. You can play it with a friend and\nsee who's the fastest paper racer, or by yourself and try to beat your record.\nGetting tired of just cruising around? Introduce the concept of \"items\" that\ngive you a boost or slow down the opponent (think Mario Kart!). If ordinary\ntracks are boring, try adding intersections or obstacles. Can you add a third\ndimension? The sky is the limit. Get out there and be creative.\n\nThis is post 018 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Fun with Pen and Paper: Race Cars","date":"2021-08-08","tags":"fun, guide, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["fun","guide","100DaysToOffload"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-06-17-host-your-own-llm","frontmatter":{"title":"Host your own LLM","date":"2024-06-17","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, homelab, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","homelab","tech","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-03-i-just-cleaned-up-40-gb-of-brew-caches","frontmatter":{"title":"I just cleaned up 40 GB of Brew caches","date":"2024-06-03","tags":"guide, note, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-04-15-beware-of-base64-encoded-strings","frontmatter":{"title":"Beware of base64 encoded strings","date":"2024-04-15","tags":"guide, note, learnings, web, til, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","learnings","web","til","tech","programming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
