{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-12-01-field-notes-3","markdownBody":"\r\nHooray! I just finished my third pocket notebook. If you have no idea what I mean, check out my [About My Pocket Notebook](/posts/2023-09-09-everyday-carry-notebooks) post.\r\n\r\nThis notebook lasted from 2023-10-09 to 2023-12-01, which is a bit longer than my last two notebooks. I believe my inner hype around this topic slowly but surely fades into the background, which is a good thing. Instead of writing almost every single day, I only write in it when I feel that something is important.\r\n\r\n![Field Notes #3](/assets/posts/2023-12-01-field-notes-3/field_notes_3.jpeg)\r\n\r\nIt aged quite well for a white notebook. You can clearly tell that I got some brand new pairs of jeans, looking at the color [before I used it](/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2#what's-next?) vs. now. Just like last time, I used this notebook for all sorts of things. Todo lists, bill calculations, random thoughts and sketches for blog posts.\r\n\r\nWhat's different this time is that I started the book off with some \"meta pages\". The first two pages serve as an index for the book. I ripped this idea stright from the [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) movement, but that's about the only thing I stole from BuJos.\r\n\r\n![Field Notes #3 Index](/assets/posts/2023-12-01-field-notes-3/field_notes_3_index.jpeg)\r\n\r\nI also dedicated one page to a general purpose packing list, which I used multiple times to check if I forgot anything for an overnight stay. This page served me very well, so I'm transfering it into my new notebook.\r\n\r\n## What's next?\r\n\r\nMy next notebook will once again be a FIELD NOTES. I just love the size, the feel and the quality of them. This time, I'm using the \"National Parks\" edition, or more specifically the \"Glacier National Park\" notebook from a set. It started to snow, so this is an obvious choice.\r\n\r\n![Field Notes #4](/assets/posts/2023-12-01-field-notes-3/field_notes_4.jpeg)\r\n\r\nThanks for sticking with me through this weird and awesome hobby!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 091 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Field Notes #3","date":"2023-12-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, notebooks"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","notebooks"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-12-29-2024-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2024 in Review","date":"2024-12-29","tags":"note, life, review"},"tags":["note","life","review"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]},{"slug":"2024-05-10-about-my-smart-g-shock","frontmatter":{"title":"About my 'smart' G-Shock","date":"2024-05-10","tags":"note, life, review, watches"},"tags":["note","life","review","watches"]},{"slug":"2024-05-08-i-sold-my-car","frontmatter":{"title":"I sold my car","date":"2024-05-08","tags":"note, life"},"tags":["note","life"]},{"slug":"2024-04-10-beating-elden-ring","frontmatter":{"title":"Beating Elden Ring","date":"2024-04-10","tags":"note, learnings, life, review, gaming"},"tags":["note","learnings","life","review","gaming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
