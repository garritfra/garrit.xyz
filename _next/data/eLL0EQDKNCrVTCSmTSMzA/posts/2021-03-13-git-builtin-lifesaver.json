But, all hope is not lost! Git never forgets.\n\nEvery action, be it committing changes, deleting or switching branches, is noted down by Git. To see your latest actions, you can simply run `git reflog` (It's pronounced `ref-log` but `re-flog` sounds just as reasonable):\n\n```\n5704fba HEAD@{45}: commit: docs: update changelog\nb471457 HEAD@{46}: commit: chore: refactor binop checks in parse_expression\n5f5c5d4 HEAD@{47}: commit: fix: struct imports\n76db271 HEAD@{48}: commit: chore: fix clippy warning\nac3e11c HEAD@{49}: commit: fix: circular imports\n0cbdc88 HEAD@{50}: am: lexer: handle ' or \" within the string properly\n27699f9 HEAD@{51}: commit: docs: spec: add notation\n```\n\nCommits in Git are just data that is not associated by anything. If you accidentally delete a branch, the commits will stay where they are, and you can reference them directly. To recreate your deleted branch, simply run this command:\n\n```\ngit checkout -b <branch> <sha>\n```\n\nAnd that's it! Your branch is restored. Remember to commit early and often, or prepare to loose your work!\n\nThis is post 015 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Git's built-in lifesaver","date":"2021-03-13","tags":"git, 100DaysToOffload, guide, tech"},"tags":["git","100DaysToOffload","guide","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-07-02-linkdump-llms","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: LLMs","date":"2024-07-02","tags":"note, tech, linkdump, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","linkdump","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
