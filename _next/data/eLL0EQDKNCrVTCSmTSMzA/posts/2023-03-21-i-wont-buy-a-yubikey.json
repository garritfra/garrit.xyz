{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-03-21-i-wont-buy-a-yubikey","markdownBody":"\nI have a YubiKey that I use for work, and I love using it. But I won't get one for my personal life.\n\nI've been thinking about this for some time now, but I ultimately don't think the benefits outweigh the hassle of always carrying around another device that I risk losing or breaking.\n\nA Yubikey provides a very good second factor, but so does my phone. My phone, just like a Yubikey, is locked behind a third factor (a pin or biometric sensor), so my phone essentially *is* a Yubikey. You can argue that the authenticator app on my phone (bitwarden) can be hacked, but I'm willing to take that risk if it means I have to reset all security measures on all accounts if I lose the key.\n\nSo, I'm not getting a Yubikey.\n\n### Replies & Mentions\n\n- [Kev Quirk: re: I won't buy a YubiKey](https://kevquirk.com/i-wont-by-a-yubikey/)\n- [Alson Kaw: Why I won't use a YubiKey](https://alsonkaw.com/muses/why-i-wont-use-a-yubikey/)\n\n---\n\nThis is post 058 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"I won't buy a YubiKey","date":"2023-03-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, privacy, security, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","privacy","security","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-07-02-linkdump-llms","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: LLMs","date":"2024-07-02","tags":"note, tech, linkdump, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","linkdump","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
