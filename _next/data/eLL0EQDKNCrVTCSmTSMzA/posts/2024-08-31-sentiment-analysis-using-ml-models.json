This method is far more reliable than the previous method of using a [rule-based sentiment analyzer](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.vader.html) through NLTK.\r\n\r\nI'm using the model [cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest?text=Messer-Angreiferin+verletzt+f%C3%BCnf+Menschen+in+einem+Bus), which was trained on a huge amount of tweets. It's really tiny (~500 MB) and easily runs inside the existing GitHub Actions workflows. You can try out the model yourself on the HuggingFace model card.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"522\" alt=\"grafik\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06f42df6-624a-4108-ada8-d0d37a53e693\">\r\n\r\nIf you want to subscribe to more positive tech news, simply replace your Hacker News feed of your RSS reader with this one (or add it if you haven't already):\r\nhttps://garritfra.github.io/positive_hackernews/feed.xml\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-07-02-linkdump-llms","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: LLMs","date":"2024-07-02","tags":"note, tech, linkdump, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","linkdump","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
