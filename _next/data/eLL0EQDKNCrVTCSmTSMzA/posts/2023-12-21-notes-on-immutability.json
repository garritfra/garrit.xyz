Accountants don't use erasers or they go to jail.\r\n\r\nThe paper [Immutability Changes Everything](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf) by Pat Helland talks about the trend towards immutability in data storage thoughout all layers of the stack. From append-only apps (Record changes, then derive the current state), down to how bits are stored on a hard drive (e.g. Copy on Write).\n\nI stumbled upon this paper through the [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/) collection. I was specifically looking for a paper that's short and easy to comprehend, since I don't have much experience in reading scientific papers. This is absolutely both short and easy to comprehend. If you're a beginner like me, I can highly recommend this one to you.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways:\r\n\r\n* Immutability enables clean replication\r\n* Change logs (e.g. [write-ahead logs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging)) are the source of truth. The database is a cache of a subset of those change logs\r\n* It's okay to consider violating [normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) rules to trade storage cost for read speed\r\n* Modern SSDs minimize wear by storing new versions of data to other blocks instead of mutating the data in place\r\n* The cost of immutability is increased storage\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 098 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on \"Immutability Changes Everything\"","date":"2023-12-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, note, learnings, review, tech, papers"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","note","learnings","review","tech","papers"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-12-29-2024-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2024 in Review","date":"2024-12-29","tags":"note, life, review"},"tags":["note","life","review"]},{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-07-02-linkdump-llms","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: LLMs","date":"2024-07-02","tags":"note, tech, linkdump, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","linkdump","llm","ai"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
