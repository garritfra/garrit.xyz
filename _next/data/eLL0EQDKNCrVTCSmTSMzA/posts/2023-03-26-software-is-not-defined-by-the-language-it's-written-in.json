By now, it kind of became a meme that people writing programs in Rust have to make explicit that \"X is written in Rust\".\n\nHow fast or safe the language is doesn't define how good the software is. Software in TypeScript can be just as good as software written in C, if written by the right people.\n\nWhen starting a new project, try to focus on the domain of the problem and pick a language based on that.
