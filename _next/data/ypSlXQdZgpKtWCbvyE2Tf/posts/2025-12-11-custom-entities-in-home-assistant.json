{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","markdownBody":"\nMy local gym has a gauge on their website that shows an approximation of how many people are currently there. Being an avid [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) user, of course I had to pipe that data into my dashboard somehow. For that, I created a simple [n8n](https://n8n.io/) workflow that scrapes the data off the gym's site and dumps it into a custom entity.\n\nBecause creating a custom entity was not quite so straight forward as I'd hoped, I wanted to share how I did it.\n\nI ended up using the `input_number` integration (which seems to come with Home Assistant) and defined an entity that I could reference through the API:\n\n```yaml\n# configuration.yaml\ninput_number:\n  easyfitness_auslastung:\n    name: EasyFitness Auslastung\n    initial: 0\n    min: 0\n    max: 100\n    step: 1\n```\n\nAfter reloading the configuration, the entity was ready to be written to.\n\nAs mentioned, I'm using a self-hosted instance of n8n on a Raspberry Pi to automate this. Using their [Home Assistant Integration](https://n8n.io/integrations/home-assistant/), you can simply address the new entity and update its state. And just like that, I was able to add a new Gauge to my dashboard!\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-03-25-container-interfaces","frontmatter":{"title":"About Container Interfaces","date":"2025-03-25","tags":"infrastructure, note, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","note","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-02-27-a-trick-to-manage-frequently-used-prompts-in-claude-chatgpt","frontmatter":{"title":"A trick to manage frequently used prompts in Claude/ChatGPT","date":"2025-02-27","tags":"guide, note, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["guide","note","tech","llm","ai"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
