{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-01-02-welcome-2023","markdownBody":"\n2022 has been an eventful year for me. We moved to a new apartment, went to a\ncouple of weddings (a good indication that we're getting older!) and finally\nstarted traveling more often.\n\nThis year, I launched two projects: [darktheme.club](https://darktheme.club) and\n[seeking-maintainers.net](https://seeking-maintainers.net). My goal for 2023 is\nto make two other projects ready for production:\n\n[Fling](https://github.com/garritfra/fling) is a household management app that\nI've been [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)\nwith my girlfriend for over a year. I just recently implemented an account\nsystem. You can in fact already download the app on the [play\nstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.garritfra.fling) and\ntest it out, though in it's current state it's just a boring app for to-do and\nshopping lists.\n\nAnother project I'm planning to launch is\n[Kubinity](https://docs.kubinity.com/). The idea behind this project is to give\nusers access to Kubernetes by allocating a namespace in a shared cluster. This\nallows for ultra cheap kubernetes hosting without the burden of maintaining and\nscaling a cluster. It also comes with free HA!\n\n## Predictions for 2023\n\n- Meta will change course (again), and kill the \"Metaverse\"\n- Cheap matter devices will enter the market. As a reference point: I predict\nthat there will be a matter-ready smart plug for under 20â‚¬ on Amazon.\n- AI generated content will be regulated in some way\n- Twitter is still around, but it's still not profitable\n- I still won't have finished my\n[#100DaysToOffload]([/posts/2021-01-11-100daystooffload](https://100daystooffload.com/))\n[challenge from 2021](/posts/2021-01-11-100daystooffload)\n\nOverall, I'm feeling very optimistic about the upcoming year. Let's see if this\nis still true at the end of this year, but let's not loose hope too early.\n\nHappy new year!\n\nThis is post 045 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome, 2023","date":"2023-01-02","tags":"note, 100DaysToOffload, life"},"tags":["note","100DaysToOffload","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-12-29-2024-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2024 in Review","date":"2024-12-29","tags":"note, life, review"},"tags":["note","life","review"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]},{"slug":"2024-05-10-about-my-smart-g-shock","frontmatter":{"title":"About my 'smart' G-Shock","date":"2024-05-10","tags":"note, life, review, watches"},"tags":["note","life","review","watches"]},{"slug":"2024-05-08-i-sold-my-car","frontmatter":{"title":"I sold my car","date":"2024-05-08","tags":"note, life"},"tags":["note","life"]},{"slug":"2024-04-10-beating-elden-ring","frontmatter":{"title":"Beating Elden Ring","date":"2024-04-10","tags":"note, learnings, life, review, gaming"},"tags":["note","learnings","life","review","gaming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
