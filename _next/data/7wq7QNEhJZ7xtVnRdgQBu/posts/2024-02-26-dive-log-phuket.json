{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2024-02-26-dive-log-phuket","markdownBody":"\nI just became a certified diver! ðŸ¥³\n\nI got my license through the [Rumblefish Adventure](https://rumblefishadventure.com/) divecenter in Kata Beach, as per a recommendation from a friend who happened to be around in the area when we were there.\n\nKata Beach is a great dive spot. It has crazy wildlife, it's just a short swim away from the beach and the visibility is quite good if you haven't seen many reefs yet (like myself).\n\nAfter doing our PADI Open Water license, we went to Phi Phi Islands to do a fun dive. The experience swimming through the reefs there can simply not be put into words.\n\nIn total, we did 7 dives in Thailand. Here's a full list, taken from my logbook:\n\n| Title                 | Date       | Site              | Depth (m) | Time (min) | Highlights                                         |\n|-----------------------|------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Open Water Training 1 | 2024-02-16 | Kata Beach        | 6.4       | 39         | First time seeing the reef!                        |\n| Open Water Training 2 | 2024-02-18 | Kata Beach        | 10.9      | 62         | Almost finished all mandatory training             |\n| Open Water Training 3 | 2024-02-18 | Ko Pu, Kata Beach | 16.3      | 44         | Artificial reefs with lots of interesting wildlife |\n| Open Water Training 4 | 2024-02-18 | Ko Pu, Kata Beach | 12.9      | 48         | Even more crazy wildlife                           |\n| Phi Phi Islands 1     | 2024-02-20 | Koh Bida Nok      | 20.5      | 51         | Sharks!                                            |\n| Phi Phi Islands 2     | 2024-02-20 | Turtle Rock       | 17.6      | 55         | Turtles, Sharks, Cave                              |\n| Phi Phi Islands 3     | 2024-02-20 | Shark Point       | 20.4      | 46         | Lots of verticality                                |\n## Photos\n\n![P2170670 - Kopie.JPG](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/1d00d17d-a889-417d-a4c9-8dd83eff58f9)\n\n![P2170752 - Kopie.JPG](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/d3b80e60-2155-481f-8232-a5a57b3898ab)\n\n![P2170727 - Kopie.JPG](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/25e75fb1-dec7-4ad2-89a9-d929144cd60a)\n\n![P2170759 - Kopie.JPG](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/1f9c2c0f-cc2e-440a-9bba-2a03c984f301)\n\n![P2180898.JPG](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/7f33d8a9-1d5f-4f94-87de-6078233be6a8)\n\n![P2180901.JPG](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/e1caf403-4ea2-4dce-a48c-1a0b5b5ce360)\n\n![P2180859.JPG](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/6fe5e666-0099-445f-bdcc-35bc0e5e9943)\n\n![P2170749 - Kopie.JPG](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/d6a239a8-fb98-478a-9e38-d15e3587a7b4)\n\n![P2180837 - Kopie.JPG](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/50fe5c89-f1cb-4a73-aac0-f1311a3116fc)\n\n![P2170733 - Kopie.JPG](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/d44f52a2-2228-4a3e-801d-930f0eddf975)\n\nAfter Phuket, we went to Vietnam where we're currently also on a lot of fun diving trips.
