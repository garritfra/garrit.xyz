This method is far more reliable than the previous method of using a [rule-based sentiment analyzer](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.vader.html) through NLTK.\r\n\r\nI'm using the model [cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest?text=Messer-Angreiferin+verletzt+f%C3%BCnf+Menschen+in+einem+Bus), which was trained on a huge amount of tweets. It's really tiny (~500 MB) and easily runs inside the existing GitHub Actions workflows. You can try out the model yourself on the HuggingFace model card.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"522\" alt=\"grafik\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06f42df6-624a-4108-ada8-d0d37a53e693\">\r\n\r\nIf you want to subscribe to more positive tech news, simply replace your Hacker News feed of your RSS reader with this one (or add it if you haven't already):\r\nhttps://garritfra.github.io/positive_hackernews/feed.xml\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-03-25-container-interfaces","frontmatter":{"title":"About Container Interfaces","date":"2025-03-25","tags":"infrastructure, note, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","note","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
