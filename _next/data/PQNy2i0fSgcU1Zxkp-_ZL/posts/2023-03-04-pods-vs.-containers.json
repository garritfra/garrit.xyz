I found a [great article](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-vs-pods/) going over the differences of the two terms.\r\n\r\n> Containers and Pods are alike. Under the hood, they heavily rely on Linux namespaces and cgroups. However, Pods aren't just groups of containers. A Pod is a self-sufficient higher-level construct. All pod's containers run on the same machine (cluster node), their lifecycle is synchronized, and mutual isolation is weakened to simplify the inter-container communication. This makes Pods much closer to traditional VMs, [bringing back the familiar deployment patterns like sidecar or reverse proxy](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/multi-container-pods-and-container-communication-in-kubernetes/).\r\n\r\nIn my own words: Containers are made up of Linux namespaces and cgroups. Pods can be thought of as a cgroup of cgroups (though not really), mimicing the behavior of a virtual machine that runs multiple containers with a synchronized lifecycle. The containers in a pod are losely isolated, making it easy to communicate between each other. Containers in a pod can however set individual resource requests, enabled by Linux namespaces.\r\n\r\nI'd highly encourage you to check out [the original article](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-vs-pods/) if you want to learn more about this topic.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 053 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Pods vs. Containers","date":"2023-03-04","tags":"note, kubernetes, infrastructure, docker, 100DaysToOffload, tech"},"tags":["note","kubernetes","infrastructure","docker","100DaysToOffload","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-03-25-container-interfaces","frontmatter":{"title":"About Container Interfaces","date":"2025-03-25","tags":"infrastructure, note, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","note","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
