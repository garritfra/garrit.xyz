{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2021-02-02-bem-methodology","markdownBody":"\nIn the coming weeks, months and years, I will be working on frontend-development as part of my dayjob. These are some personal notes I took during my research about the BEM methodology. If you want to read the official introduction, you should visit [their website](http://getbem.com/).\n\n# Overview - What is BEM?\n\nBEM — Block Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development. It aims to group css-classes in a meaningful way, making it easier to understand\n\n1. where this class is used\n2. what it describes and\n3. what state the element is in.\n\nThe BEM-notation is divided into three main parts: Blocks, Elements and Modifiers.\n\n## Blocks\n\nA standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. Some examples might be **headers, containers, menus, inputs, checkboxes**, etc.\n\n## Elements\n\nA part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block. This could be a **menu item or an input placeholder**.\n\n## Modifiers\n\nA flag on a block or an element. Used to change appearance or behavior. This might be **disabled, checked, fixed, big**, etc.\n\n# Putting it together\n\nA block itself is referenced though its name.\n\n```css\n.button {\n}\n```\n\nTo reference elements inside of the block, you add it to the block element with two underscores (`__`):\n\n```css\n.button {\n}\n.button__text {\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to add a modifier to a block or an element, you separate it with two dashes (`--`):\n\n```css\n.button {\n}\n.button--disabled {\n}\n.button__text--inverted {\n}\n```\n\n# Benefits of BEM\n\n**Modularity**: Block styles never depend on one another. They can easily be moved to other parts of the app.\n\n**Reusability**: Composing styles in a meaningful way reduces the amount of code duplication.\n\n**Structure**: BEM gives your code a solid structure that is both easy to understand and to expand.\n\n# References\n\n- http://getbem.com/\n- https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/\n\nThis is post 009 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes about BEM (Block Element Modifier)","date":"2021-02-02","tags":"note, css, 100DaysToOffload, programming, tech"},"tags":["note","css","100DaysToOffload","programming","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-13-n8n-nodes-open5e-n8n-community-node-that-lets-you-access-d-d-5th-edition-srd-content","frontmatter":{"title":"n8n-nodes-open5e: n8n community node that lets you access D&D 5th edition SRD content","date":"2026-02-13","tags":"note, tech, programming, n8n, automation, ttrpg"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","n8n","automation","ttrpg"]},{"slug":"2026-02-04-a-fix-for-long-pressing-movement-keys-in-vscode-with-vim-mode","frontmatter":{"title":"A fix for long-pressing movement keys in VSCode with Vim-Mode","date":"2026-02-04","tags":"guide, note, editors, tech, programming, vim"},"tags":["guide","note","editors","tech","programming","vim"]},{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
