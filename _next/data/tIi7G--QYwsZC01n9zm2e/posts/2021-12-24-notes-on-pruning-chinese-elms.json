To keep it alive and healthy, I devoted\nsome time to learning how to properly prune it.\n\nChinese elms are very robust trees with strong growth. Even in the winter\nseason, I can prune it on a weekly basis. I just watched [this\nvideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsvc2Ll1X2A) which gives some helpful\ntips on pruning.\n\nI noticed that the author let the tree grow heavily to develop stronger\nbranches. Until now, I pruned the branches back to one leaf whenever it had\nabout 5 leaves. However, a branch should only be cut on its woody parts in order\nto develop more shoots, and a branch needs some growth in order to turn to wood.\n**Don't prune the branches too early**!\n\nSecondly, I thought that cutting the branches just behind a leaf would lead to\nmore growth, but I found that this is not true. The branches should be cut just\na bit above the leaf to prevent branch to die back and kill the leaf. It could\nalso lead to the shoot coming out straight instead of angled, which is not\ndesired.\n\nLastly I learned that branches pointing upwards should most likely be pruned,\nsince they take a lot of energy that the tree could use elsewhere, which is also\npointed out in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93c985zOwhs).\n\nHere's a picture of my chinese elm just how I bought it. You can clearly tell\nthat it was cheaply imported from china. It needs a lot of work, but I'm having\na lot of fun learning about this tree!\n\n![Chinese Elm](/assets/chinese_elm.jpeg)\n\nThis is post 022 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on pruning chinese elms","date":"2021-12-24","tags":"bonsai, note, guide, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["bonsai","note","guide","100DaysToOffload"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-04-a-fix-for-long-pressing-movement-keys-in-vscode-with-vim-mode","frontmatter":{"title":"A fix for long-pressing movement keys in VSCode with Vim-Mode","date":"2026-02-04","tags":"guide, note, editors, tech, programming, vim"},"tags":["guide","note","editors","tech","programming","vim"]},{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-02-27-a-trick-to-manage-frequently-used-prompts-in-claude-chatgpt","frontmatter":{"title":"A trick to manage frequently used prompts in Claude/ChatGPT","date":"2025-02-27","tags":"guide, note, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["guide","note","tech","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
