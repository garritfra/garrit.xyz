It's a fascinating topic, so expect some more posts on this in the coming days and weeks.\r\n\r\nFor starters, I wanted to document how I got my first LLM running on my local machine (a 2022 MacBook Pro). [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) makes this process super easy. You just install it (`brew install ollama` in my case) and then run the model:\r\n\r\n```\r\nollama run llama3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will download the model and open a prompt, so you can start chatting right away!\r\n\r\nYou can think of Ollama as the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) CLI but for LLMs. There's a [directory of LLMs](https://ollama.com/library), and if a model has multiple different sizes, you can use it like you would pull a different docker tag:\r\n\r\n```\r\nollama pull llama3:8b\r\nollama pull llama3:70b\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe best thing about ollama is that it also exposes a web server for you to integrate the LLM into your application. As an example, here's how you would curl your local LLM:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d '{\r\n    \"model\": \"llama3\",      \r\n    \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Are you a robot?\" }],\r\n    \"stream\": false\r\n}'\r\n{\"model\":\"llama3\",\"created_at\":\"2024-06-17T11:19:23.510588Z\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"I am not a human, but I'm also not a traditional robot.

I can understand and respond to questions, make suggestions, and even tell jokes (though my humor may be a bit... algorithmic).\\n\\nSo, while I'm not a human or a traditional robot, I exist at the intersection of technology and language, designed to assist and communicate with humans in a helpful way!\"},\"done_reason\":\"stop\",\"done\":true,\"total_duration\":12565842250,\"load_duration\":7059262291,\"prompt_eval_count\":15,\"prompt_eval_duration\":331275000,\"eval_count\":156,\"eval_duration\":5172858000}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your local machine is not beefy enough and you want to try out a large LLM on a rented server (AWS has `g5.2xlarge`, which gave me good results for `mixtral 8x7b`), you also have to set `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` in your environment variables to be able to reach the remote server. **This exposes the LLM to the public internet, so be careful when chosing your deployment strategy.**\r\n\r\nAnd there you go! You just deployed your very own LLM. Pretty cool, huh?\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Host your own LLM","date":"2024-06-17","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, homelab, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","homelab","tech","llm","ai"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-13-n8n-nodes-open5e-n8n-community-node-that-lets-you-access-d-d-5th-edition-srd-content","frontmatter":{"title":"n8n-nodes-open5e: n8n community node that lets you access D&D 5th edition SRD content","date":"2026-02-13","tags":"note, tech, programming, n8n, automation, ttrpg"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","n8n","automation","ttrpg"]},{"slug":"2026-02-04-a-fix-for-long-pressing-movement-keys-in-vscode-with-vim-mode","frontmatter":{"title":"A fix for long-pressing movement keys in VSCode with Vim-Mode","date":"2026-02-04","tags":"guide, note, editors, tech, programming, vim"},"tags":["guide","note","editors","tech","programming","vim"]},{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
