{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2024-01-02-temporal-vs-fundamental-content","markdownBody":"\nI just read [this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38829907) on a thread on HackerNews which resonated with me:\n\n> I'm trying to read less temporal (things that matter now) and more fundamental (stuff that mattered 1+ year ago and will still matter in 1+ year, with even wider intervals for non-tech content).\nThis does result in missing ~important things occasionally (e.g. I still don't know what happened with SamA at OpenAI, and yes, I am curious), but that's a small price to pay for greater intellectual sanctity and an increased attention budget to distribute across important tasks or funnel into something hyper focussed.\n\nIs this news important *now* or do I benefit from it in the long term? Our time is the most precious resource we have, and we should be careful how we spend it.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Temporal vs. fundamental content","date":"2024-01-02","tags":"note, quote, life"},"tags":["note","quote","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-12-29-2024-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2024 in Review","date":"2024-12-29","tags":"note, life, review"},"tags":["note","life","review"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]},{"slug":"2024-05-10-about-my-smart-g-shock","frontmatter":{"title":"About my 'smart' G-Shock","date":"2024-05-10","tags":"note, life, review, watches"},"tags":["note","life","review","watches"]},{"slug":"2024-05-08-i-sold-my-car","frontmatter":{"title":"I sold my car","date":"2024-05-08","tags":"note, life"},"tags":["note","life"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
