{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-02-20-what-problem-does-kubernetes-solve","markdownBody":"\r\nThis is a common question that many people (including me) ask themselves.\r\n\r\nI recently came across a great [post](https://blog.adamchalmers.com/kubernetes-problems/) which explains the problem really well:\r\n\r\n> Kubernetes exists to solve one problem: how do I run m containers across n servers?\r\n\r\nThe post also nails the answer to **how** Kubernetes solves this problem:\r\n\r\n> It's a big abstract virtual computer, with its own virtual IP stack, networks, disk, RAM and CPU. It lets you deploy containers as if you were deploying them on one machine that didn't run anything else. Clusters abstract over the various physical machines that run the cluster.\r\n\r\nI'd highly encourage you to read through the article if you want to learn more about why Kubernetes exists.\r\n\r\nThis is post 048 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"What problem does Kubernetes solve?","date":"2023-02-20","tags":"note, kubernetes, infrastructure, 100DaysToOffload, tech"},"tags":["note","kubernetes","infrastructure","100DaysToOffload","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2025-03-25-container-interfaces","frontmatter":{"title":"About Container Interfaces","date":"2025-03-25","tags":"infrastructure, note, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","note","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-02-27-a-trick-to-manage-frequently-used-prompts-in-claude-chatgpt","frontmatter":{"title":"A trick to manage frequently used prompts in Claude/ChatGPT","date":"2025-02-27","tags":"guide, note, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["guide","note","tech","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
