{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2025-02-27-a-trick-to-manage-frequently-used-prompts-in-claude-chatgpt","markdownBody":"\nSo far, whenever I wanted to recycle a prompt from another context in [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) (though this also applies to ChatGPT and some other LLMs), I went back in my conversation history, copied the prompt, pasted it in a new chat and adjusted the context. But I recently discovered that [Claude Projects](https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects) can be misused as \"prompt templates\", which makes it way easier to handle repetitive tasks.\n\nIn Projects, you can set a system prompt that will be applied to all conversations in the project. I guess it's supposed to be used for relevant information about whatever you want to work on, but I like to think about a project more as a prompt template, rather than a project. For example, here's a project prompt that I use to brainstorm project ideas:\n\n> Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Letâ€™s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.\n\n(Stolen from [this](https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/) great blog post)\n\nWhile you could copy and paste this from a text file into every new conversation, Claude's projects make it super easy to save this as a template.\n\nI guess this is an obvious feature for some people, but to me, it was a huge help once I found this out.\n\nGot any other neat tricks for working with LLMs? I'd love to hear them!\n","frontmatter":{"title":"A trick to manage frequently used prompts in Claude/ChatGPT","date":"2025-02-27","tags":"guide, note, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["guide","note","tech","llm","ai"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-03-25-container-interfaces","frontmatter":{"title":"About Container Interfaces","date":"2025-03-25","tags":"infrastructure, note, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","note","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
