Cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied, and evil the mind that is held by no head.\"\r\n>\r\n> â€” H.P. Lovecraft\r\n\r\nI loved reading [The Festival](https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/f.aspx) by H.P. Lovecraft, especially this quote by \"the mad Arab\" at the end of the story. The Festival is one of Lovecrafts first short stories in the [Cthulhu Mythos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos). The quote excellently shows the unique style of Lovecrafts short stories. Each story is a grotesque depiction of horrors that are beyond our imagination. I recently tried to replicate this style of writing in  \"[Haunted Memories](/posts/2023-09-10-short-story-haunted-memories)\", a short story about digital media. I'm just getting started with reading Lovecrafts stories, but the ones I read so far absolutely blew me away.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Cosmic Horror: The Festival","date":"2024-02-10","tags":"note, quote, writing, review, horror"},"tags":["note","quote","writing","review","horror"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-12-29-2024-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2024 in Review","date":"2024-12-29","tags":"note, life, review"},"tags":["note","life","review"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]},{"slug":"2024-05-10-about-my-smart-g-shock","frontmatter":{"title":"About my 'smart' G-Shock","date":"2024-05-10","tags":"note, life, review, watches"},"tags":["note","life","review","watches"]},{"slug":"2024-04-10-beating-elden-ring","frontmatter":{"title":"Beating Elden Ring","date":"2024-04-10","tags":"note, learnings, life, review, gaming"},"tags":["note","learnings","life","review","gaming"]},{"slug":"2024-04-07-five-years-of-blogging","frontmatter":{"title":"Five Years of Blogging","date":"2024-04-07","tags":"note, books, writing, meta"},"tags":["note","books","writing","meta"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
