{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-04-27-migrating-homeassistant-from-sd-to-ssd","markdownBody":"\nI finally got frustrated with the performance of my Raspberry Pi 4 running Homeassistant on a SD card, so I went ahead and got an SSD.\r\n\r\nThe migration was **very** easy:\r\n\r\n1. Create and download a full backup through the UI\r\n2. Flash Homeassistant onto the SSD\r\n3. Remove the SD card and plug the SSD into a USB 3.0 port of the Pi\r\n4. Boot\r\n5. Go through the onboarding procedure\r\n6. Restore Backup\r\n7. Profit\r\n\r\nIt worked like a charm! The speed has improved A LOT, and everything was set up as it should be. \r\n\r\n...Until we turned on the lights in the livingroom. My ZigBee-dongle, plugged into another USB port, wasn't able to communicate with the devices on the network.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging around, I came across several threads stating that an SSD over USB 3.0 apparently creates a lot of interference to surrounding hardware, including my ZigBee dongle. The fix was simple: either get an extension port for the dongle, or plug the SSD into a USB 2.0 port of the Pi. Since I didn't have an extension cord to get the dongle far away enough from the SSD, I went with the latter option for now. And that fixed it! The performance was much worse, but still better than the SD I used before. My next step will be to grab an extension cord from my parents. I'm sure they won't mind.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 066 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating Homeassistant from SD to SSD","date":"2023-04-27","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, homeassistant, homelab"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","homeassistant","homelab"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-12-18-overcoming-air-hunger","frontmatter":{"title":"Overcoming \"air hunger\"","date":"2023-12-18","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, life, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","life","til"]},{"slug":"2023-11-01-tracking-sqlite-database-changes-in-git","frontmatter":{"title":"Tracking SQLite Database Changes in Git","date":"2023-11-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech, sqlite"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech","sqlite"]},{"slug":"2023-10-13-organizing-multiple-git-identities","frontmatter":{"title":"Organizing multiple Git identities","date":"2023-10-13","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, til, git, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","til","git","tech"]},{"slug":"2023-06-01-single-page-applications-on-github-pages","frontmatter":{"title":"Single Page Applications on GitHub Pages","date":"2023-06-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, web, javascript, github"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","web","javascript","github"]},{"slug":"2023-04-12-instant-dark-theme","frontmatter":{"title":"Instant dark theme","date":"2023-04-12","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, learnings, web, css, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","learnings","web","css","til"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
