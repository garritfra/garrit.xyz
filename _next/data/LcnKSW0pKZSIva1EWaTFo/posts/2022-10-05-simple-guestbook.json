{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-10-05-simple-guestbook","markdownBody":"\n> **TL;DR**: Click [here](/guestbook) to view the guestbook.\n\nFor a while now, I wanted to have a quick way to update the pages on my website.\n\nGitHub has the\n[\".\"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts#source-code-editing)\nhotkey, which opens a web based editor for the file you're currently viewing.\nThis site now has this feature as well! To try it out, just hit `.`, and you'll\nbe redirected to the file editor for this page.\n\nTo see how I implemented this feature, you take a look at\n[this](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/commit/658efa3a3ebfebebbf74d0eb6aae6c1cc9566516)\ncommit. It boils down to this snippet of code:\n\n```js\nwindow.addEventListener(\"keypress\", (e) => {\n\tif (e.key === \".\") {\n\t\tconst baseUrl = \"https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/edit/main/content\";\n\t\tconst filePath = window.location.pathname;\n\t\tconst url = `${baseUrl}${filePath}.md`;\n\n\t\twindow.location.href = url;\n\t}\n});\n```\n\nPretty simple, huh?\n\nSince this doesn't work on mobile devices, I also added [a custom 404\npage](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/commit/8c374a8bc0b66192c454300489fee52e7299c9dd#diff-2cbafea0c9dff483ebab9ad670b1cdb3eb7aac552f9c161e42fee84c2efe3a69)\nwhich also redirects to the editor, if the filepath ends with in `/edit`.\n\nLet's have some fun and put this feature to use. I added a simple\n[guestbook](/guestbook) to this site, which is open to receive pull requests.\nI'd love to hear from you!\n\nThis is post 040 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"A simple guestbook","date":"2022-10-05","tags":"note, meta, 100DaysToOffload, guide"},"tags":["note","meta","100DaysToOffload","guide"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-02-27-a-trick-to-manage-frequently-used-prompts-in-claude-chatgpt","frontmatter":{"title":"A trick to manage frequently used prompts in Claude/ChatGPT","date":"2025-02-27","tags":"guide, note, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["guide","note","tech","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-06-17-host-your-own-llm","frontmatter":{"title":"Host your own LLM","date":"2024-06-17","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, homelab, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","homelab","tech","llm","ai"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
