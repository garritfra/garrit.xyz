{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2024-04-15-beware-of-base64-encoded-strings","markdownBody":"\r\nI just encountered a fun little bug that I thought is worth sharing.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**: the base64 util breaks lines after a certain number of columns. Use a [flag](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/base64.1.html) to specify \"don't break\". Here's the commit that fixes the issue:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1588\" alt=\"image (3)\" src=\"https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/dba76692-c89f-44da-b70a-f6732a406d75\">\r\n\r\nIt started when we noticed that a cronjob that used wget to regularly call an endpoint failed on one specific environment. The endpoint uses [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), which is essentially a header with a [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded representation of a username and password. [Curl](https://curl.se/) has this functionality [built in](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-u), but to keep the attack surface as small as possible, we decided to stick to [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), which is part of busybox, to keep the container image size under 1 MB (!). After all, all we want to do is ping an endpoint.\r\n\r\nThis is the command we used up to this point:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwget --post-data=\"\" -O - --header=\"Authorization: Basic $(echo -n $BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD | base64)\" http://endpoint:8080/v1/cache\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe noticed that the request worked fine on non-prod environments, but it failed on production with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe HTTP header line [b2verlk1rwjsnutbcapkjh==] does not conform to RFC 7230. The request has been rejected.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter digging around for a while and separating out the individual pieces of the commands, I noticed that the subcommand to build the header value (`echo -n $BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD | base64`) behaved differently on prod vs. non-prod. The password on prod is way longer compared to the other environments. Let's run this command with a short input:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/ $ echo -n someuser:somepassword | base64\r\nc29tZXVzZXI6c29tZXBhc3N3b3Jk\r\n/ $\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd again with a long input:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/ $ echo -n someuser:somepasswordthatswaylongerthanthefirstonebutalsoverysecureandsafe | base64\r\nc29tZXVzZXI6c29tZXBhc3N3b3JkdGhhdHN3YXlsb25nZXJ0aGFudGhlZmlyc3RvbmVidXRhbHNv\r\ndmVyeXNlY3VyZWFuZHNhZmU=\r\n/ $\r\n```\r\n\r\nBingo! There's a rogue newline character in the output of `base64`. The fix is very straight-forward. Using the `-w0` [flag for base64](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/base64.1.html), we can force the output to be on the same line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/ $ echo -n someuser:somepasswordthatswaylongerthanthefirstonebutalsoverysecureandsafe | base64 -w0\r\nc29tZXVzZXI6c29tZXBhc3N3b3JkdGhhdHN3YXlsb25nZXJ0aGFudGhlZmlyc3RvbmVidXRhbHNvdmVyeXNlY3VyZWFuZHNhZmU=\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis eventually fixed the issue. Not something I would've ever thought of!\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Beware of base64 encoded strings","date":"2024-04-15","tags":"guide, note, learnings, web, til, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","learnings","web","til","tech","programming"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2025-02-27-a-trick-to-manage-frequently-used-prompts-in-claude-chatgpt","frontmatter":{"title":"A trick to manage frequently used prompts in Claude/ChatGPT","date":"2025-02-27","tags":"guide, note, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["guide","note","tech","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-07-02-linkdump-llms","frontmatter":{"title":"🔗 Linkdump: LLMs","date":"2024-07-02","tags":"note, tech, linkdump, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","linkdump","llm","ai"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
