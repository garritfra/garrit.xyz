{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2024-06-03-i-just-cleaned-up-40-gb-of-brew-caches","markdownBody":"\r\n> **EDIT**: This trick will probably not be as effective on your system as it was on my system. After writing this post I realized that I had the `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP=1` flag enabled on my system.\r\n\r\nMy system (MacOS) is getting more cluttered the more I use it. I'm sure you can relate. If you're using [Brew](https://brew.sh/) as your package manager (which you should ðŸ˜‰), you might want to consider running the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew cleanup -s\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some reason this failed after some time with a \"directory not found\" error, but you can just run it again and it will continue cleaning up old caches. Once it was done, this freed up **40 GB of disk space** on my system. It might make sense to run this as a cronjob? Either way, I just wanted to jot this down before I enevitably forget this, as usual.\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"I just cleaned up 40 GB of Brew caches","date":"2024-06-03","tags":"guide, note, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-03-25-container-interfaces","frontmatter":{"title":"About Container Interfaces","date":"2025-03-25","tags":"infrastructure, note, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","note","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-02-27-a-trick-to-manage-frequently-used-prompts-in-claude-chatgpt","frontmatter":{"title":"A trick to manage frequently used prompts in Claude/ChatGPT","date":"2025-02-27","tags":"guide, note, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["guide","note","tech","llm","ai"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
