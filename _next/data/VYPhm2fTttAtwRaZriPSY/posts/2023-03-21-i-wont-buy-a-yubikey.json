My phone, just like a Yubikey, is locked behind a third factor (a pin or biometric sensor), so my phone essentially *is* a Yubikey. You can argue that the authenticator app on my phone (bitwarden) can be hacked, but I'm willing to take that risk if it means I have to reset all security measures on all accounts if I lose the key.\n\nSo, I'm not getting a Yubikey.\n\n### Replies & Mentions\n\n- [Kev Quirk: re: I won't buy a YubiKey](https://kevquirk.com/i-wont-by-a-yubikey/)\n- [Alson Kaw: Why I won't use a YubiKey](https://alsonkaw.com/muses/why-i-wont-use-a-yubikey/)\n\n---\n\nThis is post 058 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"I won't buy a YubiKey","date":"2023-03-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, privacy, security"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","privacy","security"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-04-07-older-is-often-better","markdownBody":"\nI'm guilty of buying shiny new things. After being unhappy with the Bluetooth connectivity in the OnePlus Nord I bought in december of 2020, I bought a brand new Pixel 7 last december. I told myself that t would be using the OnePlus Nord for at least three years, preferably four, yet I gave in after two years due to some issue that could have been fixed with a pair of cable-headphones. I'm now asking myself again: am I able to use my new Pixel 7 for more than 3 years?\n\nI just stumbled upon a blog post called \"[My long goodbye to Windows XP](https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/my-long-goodbye-to-windows-xp)\", in which the author explains that he is currently replacing his 2008 laptop running Windows XP with a \"new\" PC running Windows 7. He states that he knew the ins and outs of this operating system, so why switch to a new one? Eventually he did switch, but to an OS that is already end of life.\n\nI totally love this. If you're happy with what you got, you shouldn't let a new feature dictate how to change your workflow. Does one really need the features introduced in some software/hardware/tool in the past year? Wouldn't it make sense to use the things that have been battle-tested for at least a few years?\n\nAs I said, I'm very guilty of living at the cutting edge of technology.

In a nutshell, PGP is an encryption standard with a wide range of use cases. For quite some time, I didn't see the point of keeping a PGP keypair. It seemed like a burden to securely keep track of the key(s). Once you loose it, you will loose the trust of others. But after doing some research on the topic, I found that it's not actually that much of a hassle, while giving you many benefits.\n\n# The Why\n\nThe most obvious benefit is encrypting and decrypting messages and files. If you upload your public key, I can encrypt our private conversations. Nobody will be able to read what we're chatting about. If you fear that cloud providers will read through your documents, you can also go ahead and encrypt all of your data with your keypair.\n\nBut PGP is not just about encryption. A keypair also gives you a proof of identity. If I see that a piece of work is signed by you, I can be certain that you and only you have worked on this. By signing the keys of people we trust, we build a \"chain of trust\". A key with many signatures generally has a higher reputation than one without any signatures.\n\nTake Git commits for example. All it takes is a `git config user.email \"elon@spacex.com\"` and I can publish code under a different identity. But if everyone on the team signed their work, they will quickly see that a commit is missing its signature, because I'm simply not able to sign my work with Elon Musk's keypair. Only if they see a badge like this, they will know that they can trust it.\n\nYour keypair can also come in handy as a SSH key. Before I knew about PGP, I always had to install one key per machine I was working on. With PGP, you only have a single identity, and therefore you only have to install one key on your servers.\n\n# The How\n\nLet's first go over the process of setting up a keypair. For this, we will need the `gpg` command installed on our system. Usually, this is just a `<package manager> install gpg` away. Then, we will have to generate a keypair. The quickest way to get one is to use `gpg --gen-key`, but that will make some quirky assumptions about how you want to use your key.\n\nIn PGP, there is this concept of a **keyring**. A keyring has one master key and many subkeys. It is generally a good idea to have one fat master key that never expires and many small subkeys that last about a year or two. The benefit of structuring your keys like this is that you will always have your trusted keychain, and in case something goes south, E.g. your key gets compromised, you can replace that subkey and keep your identity.\n\nWith that in mind, let's create our master key. Run `gpg --full-gen-key` and follow the instructions. You probably want to use the `RSA and RSA (default)` option, and a key that is 4096 bits long (remember, this is the fat master key that never expires, so it must be secure). The comment can be left blank, unless you know what you are doing with that field. Enter a strong passphrase! If your private key were to get compromised, this passphrase is your last line of defense. Make it long, hard to crack but still rememberable. If everything went well, your key should be generated. Here's the full example output:\n\n```\nroot@c6acc9eb4fd1:/# gpg --full-gen-key\ngpg (GnuPG) 2.2.19; Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\nPlease select what kind of key you want:\n   (1) RSA and RSA (default)\n   (2) DSA and Elgamal\n   (3) DSA (sign only)\n   (4) RSA (sign only)\n  (14) Existing key from card\nYour selection? 1\nRSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.\nWhat keysize do you want?

Take the fingerprint of the key (that large number in the output) and run `gpg --edit-key --expert <your fingerprint>`. Run `addkey` three times to add these three keys:\n\n## Signing key\n\nThis key will be used to sign your work (git commits, tags, etc.).\n\n```\ngpg> addkey\n```\n\n1. Choose option \"RSA (set your own capabilities)\", which is currently number 8.\n1. Toggle E (Encryption) so the \"Current allowed actions\" only lists Sign and confirm with Q.\n1. Choose the keysize 2048 (or whatever you prefer).\n1. Choose the key expire date 1y (or whatever you prefer).\n1. Confirm twice, then enter your passphrase.\n\n## Encryption key\n\nThis key will be used to encrypt and decrypt messages.\n\n```\ngpg> addkey\n```\n\n1. Choose option \"RSA (set your own capabilities)\", which is currently number 8.\n1. Toggle S (Sign) so the \"Current allowed actions\" only lists Encryption and confirm with Q.\n1. Choose the keysize 2048 (or whatever you prefer).\n1. Choose the key expire date 1y (or whatever you prefer).\n1. Confirm twice, then enter your passphrase.\n\n## Authentication key\n\nThis key will be used for SSH authentication.\n\n```\ngpg> addkey\n```\n\n1. Choose option \"RSA (set your own capabilities)\", which is currently number 8.\n1. Toggle S (Signing), E (Encryption) and A (Authentication) so the \"Current allowed actions\" only lists Authenticate and confirm with Q.\n1. Choose the keysize 2048 (or whatever you prefer).\n1. Choose the key expire date 1y (or whatever you prefer).\n1. Confirm twice, then enter your passphrase.\n\nNow you should have one key per use case: signing, encrypting and authentication, each with an expiration date:\n\n```\nsec  rsa4096/C8E4854970B7A1A3\n     created: 2021-04-07  expires: never       usage: SC\n     trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate\nssb  rsa4096/C5F71423813B40A0\n     created: 2021-04-07  expires: never       usage: E\nssb  rsa2048/52D4D1D19533D8A5\n     created: 2021-04-07  expires: 2022-04-07  usage: S\nssb  rsa2048/072D841844E3F949\n     created: 2021-04-07  expires: 2022-04-07  usage: E\nssb  rsa2048/42E4F6E376DD92F6\n     created: 2021-04-07  expires: 2022-04-07  usage: A\n[ultimate] (1). Foo Bar <foo@bar.com>\n```\n\nSave your key, and optionally upload it to one of the many keyservers:\n\n```\ngpg> save\n\n$ gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org  --send-keys foo@bar.com\n```\n\n**Pro tip**: To set a default keyserver (I use `keys.opengpg.org`, but there are many others out there!), simply add it in your `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf` file:\n\n```\nkeyserver keys.openpgp.org\n```\n\nPeople can now import your public key via `gpg --keyserver keys.opengpg.org --search-keys foo@bar.com`.\n\nWe're done with the setup, let's put our keys to use!\n\n## Code Signing\n\nTo sign your code, you will have to tell git which key to use. Edit your global git options (`~/.gitconfig`) and add these fields:\n\n```\n[commit]\n\tgpgsign = true\n[tag]\n\tgpgsign = true\n[user]\n    name = Foo Bar\n\tsigningkey = 52D4D1D19533D8A5      # Use the ID of your signing key\n\temail = foo@bar.com\n```\n\nNow, whenever you add a commit, git will sign it with your key. You will have to let your git hosting provider know that this key is yours. Go to your account settings and look for a tab that says \"Manage (GPG) keys\". Where this tab is depends on your choice of service. Next, run `gpg --export --armor <your master key id>` and copy the resulting key into the input field of your git hosting service.\n\nWhenever you push a commit, its signature will be checked against that of your account. And that's all the magic!\n\n![A signed commit](/assets/signed_commit.png)\n\n## Encrypting messages\n\nIn order to send an encrypted message to someone, you will need his public key. There are numerous ways to obtain a public key of someone. The simplest way is to ask the person for the raw key. If it's in a text file, you can import it like so:\n\n```\ncat some_key.txt | gpg --import\n```\n\nOftentimes, people will store their keys on a keyserver, just like you have probably done it. To import someones key, simply search for it on a keyserver. I'll use my key here as an example.\n\n```\ngpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org  --search-keys garrit@slashdev.space\n```\n\nNow, your computer should know about my key. To verify that it's actually me you have imported, you can check if the output of `gpg --fingerprint garrit@slashdev.space` matches my actual fingerprint: `2218 337E 54AA 1DBE 207B 404D BB54 AF7E B093 9F3D`.\n\nOptionally, if you trust that the key is actually associated to me, you can sign it. This let's other people know that you trust me, which helps build a so called \"chain of trust\". A key which has been signed by many people is generally more trustworthy than one that has no signatures.\n\n```\ngpg --sign-key garrit@slashdev.space\n```\n\nNow, let's encrypt a message that only I will be able to read:\n\n```\nprintf \"If you can read this, you've successfully decrypted this message\" | gpg --encrypt --sign --armor -r garrit@slashdev.space\n```\n\nFeel free to send this message to my email-address, I'm happy to chat with you!\n\nDecrypting something is as easy as encrypting something. Say the encrypted message lives in `message.txt.asc`. If you are the recipient, all you have to do is to run `gpg --decrypt message.txt.asc`.\n\n## SSH\n\nYour PGP key can also be used as an SSH key to authenticate on your servers.\n\nFirst we need to add the following to `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` to enable SSH support in gpg-agent.\n\n```\nenable-ssh-support\n```\n\nNext, we'll need to tell gpg which key to use. We need to get the so called `keygrip` of your authentication key and add it to the `~/.gnupg/sshcontrol`. The keygrip can be obtained by running `gpg -K --with-keygrip`. Just copy the keygrip of the authentication key and paste it into the `~/.gnupg/sshcontrol` file.\n\nThen, we want the ssh agent to know where to look for the key. Put this in your `.bashrc` file (or corresponding config):\n\n```\nexport GPG_TTY=$(tty)\nexport SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)\ngpgconf --launch gpg-agent\n```\n\nThen, run `ssh-add -l` to load the key directly.\n\nTo get the public ssh key of your keypair, run this command:\n\n```\ngpg --export-ssh-key foo@bar.com\n```\n\nand add the output to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on your server. When signing in, you should be prompted to enter the passphrase of your key and then authenticated.\n\n## Closing thoughts\n\nI hope by now you see the benefits you gain from having a PGP keypair. Whether you find it useful enough to set one up is of course up to you. It is however a good practice to at least sign your git commits as a proof of identity. There are services like [Keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org) that let you keep a \"public record\" of your key, so that other people can verify your identity more easily. If you set up your key, let me know by sending an encrypted message!\n\nThis is post 016 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"A pretty good guide to pretty good privacy","date":"2021-04-07","tags":"privacy, guide, 100DaysToOffload"},"tags":["privacy","guide","100DaysToOffload"]},{"slug":"2021-01-07-delete-facebook","markdownBody":"\nI know I should have done this a while ago, but with ever-increasing scandals about data privacy surrounding Facebook, I finally decided to get rid of it.\n\nI haven't used the service in a long time anyway, but I always told myself \"what if I needed the data later?\", or \"what if a friend contacted me, and I didn't respond?\", \"what if I missed the birthday of someone I'm close with?!\".
