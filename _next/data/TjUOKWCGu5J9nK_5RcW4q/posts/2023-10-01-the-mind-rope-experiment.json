Now, step by step, slowly walk across this rope until you're at the other side.\n\nI often use this experiment as an indication for how focused I am at a given moment. As easy as this sounds, I rarely make it to the other side. On some days, I can't even step on the rope before my mind gets distracted and I have to start over. On some other days, I may get a few steps before falling off. With enough practice however, I may get to the other side.\n\nThis technique also works very well for short meditation sessions. I close my eyes and try to get to the other side. Whenever I fall off, I try again until my mind is focused enough to walk the entire rope.\n\nI'm curious: are you able to walk the entire rope, or are you also struggling to take control over this mindscape?\n\n---\n\nThis is post 079 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The Mind Rope Experiment","date":"2023-10-01","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-02-the-cult-of-done-manifesto","frontmatter":{"title":"The Cult of Done Manifesto","date":"2026-02-02","tags":"note, practices, writing, life"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-12-29-2024-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2024 in Review","date":"2024-12-29","tags":"note, life, review"},"tags":["note","life","review"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
