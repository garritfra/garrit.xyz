It assumes that you are using\nan apollo server of version 3 or higher.\n\n### What is Server-Side Caching?\n\nThe point of server-side caching is to reduce the load of your database by\n“remembering” the results of a query for a certain period. If the exact same\nquery comes in again, that remembered result will be returned.\n\nCaching should be handled with care. You should never enable caching for your\nentire application. Instead, you should identify the bottlenecks and develop a\nstrategy to overcome them.\n\n### Enabling caching on the server\n\nThe Apollo Team has done a great job\n[documenting](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/caching/)\nthe caching behavior of their server. To add caching to your existing\nApollo-Server, you first have to add the `responseCachePlugin` to your\nconfiguration as shown\n[here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/caching/#caching-with-responsecacheplugin-advanced):\n\n```js\nimport responseCachePlugin from \"apollo-server-plugin-response-cache\";\n\nconst server = new ApolloServer({\n\t// ...other options...\n\tplugins: [responseCachePlugin()],\n});\n```\n\nThen, you have to configure a cache backend. By default, Apollo Server will\nstore the caches in RAM, but I’d recommend [using\nRedis](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/data-sources/#using-memcachedredis-as-a-cache-storage-backend)\n(or Memcached, if you like), especially if your application is spread across\nmultiple instances of the same backend.\n\n```js\nconst { BaseRedisCache } = require(\"apollo-server-cache-redis\");\nconst Redis = require(\"ioredis\");\n\nconst server = new ApolloServer({\n\t// ...\n\tcache: new BaseRedisCache({\n\t\tplugins: [responseCachePlugin()],\n\t\tclient: new Redis({\n\t\t\thost: \"redis-server\",\n\t\t}),\n\t}),\n});\n```\n\n> Note that you have to use the ioredis library here. node_redis is deprecated\n> as of v2.6.0 of apollo-server-cache-redis.\n\nIf everything went well, your server should now know how to cache responses!\nThis alone won’t get you very far, since it doesn’t know what to cache.\n\n### Telling Apollo what to cache\n\nTo make a type cachable, you have to declare **cache hints**. These properties\ncan either be set in the\n[resolver](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/caching/#in-your-resolvers-dynamic),\nor\n[statically](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/caching/#in-your-schema-static)\nin the schema. To keep it simple, this guide will stick to the static method.\nFeel free to experiment with the dynamic approach though!\n\nTo enable cache hints, simply add the following directive to your schema (you\nonly have to do this once):\n\n```gql\nenum CacheControlScope {\n\tPUBLIC\n\tPRIVATE\n}\n\ndirective @cacheControl(\n\tmaxAge: Int\n\tscope: CacheControlScope\n\tinheritMaxAge: Boolean\n) on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT | INTERFACE | UNION\n```\n\nNow you can add the `@cacheControl` directive to every type that should be cached.\n\n```gql\n# This type will be cached for 30 seconds\ntype Post @cacheControl(maxAge: 30) {\n\tid: ID!\n\ttitle: String\n\tauthor: Author\n\tcomments: [Comment]\n}\n```\n\nFor security reasons, these conditions are [very\nstrict](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/caching/#why-are-these-the-maxage-defaults):\n\n> Our philosophy behind Apollo Server caching is that a response should only be\n> considered cacheable if every part of that response opts in to being\n> cacheable.\n\nThis means that every type needs to explicitly decide how long it should be\ncached. According to this note, the example above actually won’t be cached at\nall!\n\nHaving to specify the `maxAge` of every type would be tedious, so the authors\nhave come up with the `inheritMaxAge` property, which allows the type to\ninherit the settings from its parent. So, in order to make our example\ncachable, we have to enable cache control for all its subfields, either by\nsetting the `maxAge` explicitly or by inheriting it from the parent:\n\n```gql\ntype Post @cacheControl(maxAge: 30) {\n\tid: ID!\n\ttitle: String\n\tauthor: Author\n\tcomments: [Comment]\n}\n\ntype Author @cacheControl(inheritMaxAge: true) {\n\tid: ID!\n\tname: String\n}\n\ntype Comment @cacheControl(inheritMaxAge: true) {\n\tid: ID!\n\tbody: String\n}\n```\n\nNow, whenever you query a `Post`, it will be thrown in the cache. If you query\nthe type again within 30 seconds, the query resolver won’t execute. Instead, it\nwill be read from the cache. Keep in mind that cache hints can also be set on\n`query` and `mutation` fields. This can be handy if you want to cache the\nentire response of a request.\n\n### Gotcha 1: Multiple Response Variations\n\nThe use-case where this topic first came up required us to have different\nresponses based on the type of the logged in user. An `Admin` should see a\ndifferent result than a `Visitor`. If you ignore this fact, it could be that a\nvisitor could see the cache result of a query previously executed by an admin!\n\nThis problem can be counteracted by setting extra information in the cache key\nvia `extraCacheKeyData` (see\n[this](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/caching/#configuring-reads-and-writes)\nparagraph):\n\n```js\nplugins: [\n    responseCachePlugin({\n        extraCacheKeyData: (ctx) => (\n            ctx.context.auth.isAdmin\n        ),\n    }),\n],\n```\n\nThis example can create two distinct caches: One for users that are marked as\nadmins, and one for regular users.\n\n### Gotcha 2: User-specific caches\n\nBesides caching for a group of users, you can also cache responses [for every\nuser\nindividually](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/caching/#identifying-users-for-private-responses).\nYou may have noticed that you can also set a `scope` field in the cache control\ndirective. This will only cache the response if a user is logged in:\n\n```gql\ntype Post {\n\tid: ID!\n\ttitle: String\n\tauthor: Author @cacheControl(maxAge: 10, scope: PRIVATE)\n}\n```\n\nApollo determines if a user is logged in or not, based on if the `sessionId`\nfunction has returned a value other than `null`.\n\n```js\nimport responseCachePlugin from \"apollo-server-plugin-response-cache\";\nconst server = new ApolloServer({\n\t// ...other settings...\n\tplugins: [\n\t\tresponseCachePlugin({\n\t\t\tsessionId: (requestContext) =>\n\t\t\t\trequestContext.request.http.headers.get(\"sessionid\") || null,\n\t\t}),\n\t],\n});\n```\n\nI’m unsure how effective this pattern is, since every user will receive its key\nin the cache. This kind of defeats the purpose of server-side caching, which is\nmeant to reduce load on the database. If you’re trying to cache fields for\nindividual users, you might also want to take a look at client-side caching via\n[apollo-augmented-hooks](https://github.com/appmotion/apollo-augmented-hooks).\n\nThis is post 020 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Server-Side Caching with Apollo GraphQL","date":"2021-10-04","tags":"javascript, graphql, guide, 100DaysToOffload, programming, tech"},"tags":["javascript","graphql","guide","100DaysToOffload","programming","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2023-12-28-linkdump-2","frontmatter":{"title":"Linkdump #2","date":"2023-12-28","tags":"note, tech, programming, linkdump"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","linkdump"]},{"slug":"2023-12-22-10-000-hours","frontmatter":{"title":"10.000 Hours","date":"2023-12-22","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, learnings, books, tech, programming"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","learnings","books","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2023-12-21-notes-on-immutability","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on \"Immutability Changes Everything\"","date":"2023-12-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, infrastructure, note, learnings, review, tech, papers"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","infrastructure","note","learnings","review","tech","papers"]},{"slug":"2023-12-18-overcoming-air-hunger","frontmatter":{"title":"Overcoming \"air hunger\"","date":"2023-12-18","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, life, til"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","life","til"]},{"slug":"2023-11-29-real-vs.-fake-trends","frontmatter":{"title":"Real vs. Fake Trends","date":"2023-11-29","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, quote, opinion, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","quote","opinion","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
