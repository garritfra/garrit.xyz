{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","markdownBody":"\nJust a quick note to my future self on how to test a SMTP connection with nothing but a tiny busybox container.\r\n\r\nIn my case specifically, I tested the connection from inside a Kubernetes cluster. Here's the quickest way to get a temporary pod up and running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl run -n backend -i --tty --rm debug --image=busybox --restart=Never\r\n```\r\n\r\nBusybox comes with telnet installed, which we can use to establish a connection to the server:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/ # telnet smtp.mydomain.com 25\r\nConnected to smtp.mydomain.com\r\n220 mail.mydomain.com ESMTP Postfix (SMTP)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we can issue the SMTP commands through the open TCP connection to send a test mail. Lines beginning with a status code are server responses:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHELO smtp.mydomain.com\r\n250 smtp.mydomain.com\r\nMAIL FROM:<noreply@mydomain.com>                         \r\n250 2.1.0 Ok\r\nRCPT TO:<receiver@foo.com>\r\n250 2.1.5 Ok\r\nDATA  \r\n354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>\r\nFrom: [noreply] <noreply@mydomain.com>\r\nTo: [Receiver] <receiver@foo.com>\r\nDate: Thu, 27 Jun 2024 10:08:26 -0200\r\nSubject: Test Message\r\n\r\nThis is a test message.\r\n\r\n.\r\n250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as 2478B7F135\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case there's a firewall issue, you might not be able to establish a connection in the first place, or you won't get a reply to your TCP commands. In our case, everything worked fine.\r\n\r\nI hope this is useful!\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-03-25-container-interfaces","frontmatter":{"title":"About Container Interfaces","date":"2025-03-25","tags":"infrastructure, note, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","note","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-02-27-a-trick-to-manage-frequently-used-prompts-in-claude-chatgpt","frontmatter":{"title":"A trick to manage frequently used prompts in Claude/ChatGPT","date":"2025-02-27","tags":"guide, note, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["guide","note","tech","llm","ai"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
