{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-02-22-dockerignore-troubles","markdownBody":"\r\nI commonly used to create a `.Dockerignore` file next to my `Dockerfile`. After countless hours of ignoring the problems in my setup, I found out that the uppercase `.Dockerignore` doesn't get picked up by Docker on MacOS. Only the lowercase `.dockerignore` is valid.\r\n\r\nI didn't find official documentation on this, but I think it's because both MacOS and Linux are case-sensitive, while Windows isn't. I don't remember why I got used to the `.Dockerignore` convention, but I swear I saw someone using it in the wild. Or it's my (un)logical reasoning that, because `Dockerfile` is uppercased, `.Dockerignore` should be uppercased as well.\r\n\r\nEither way, stay away from `.Dockerfile`s and stick to `.dockerfile`s.\r\n\r\nThis is post 050 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Dockerignore troubles","date":"2023-02-22","tags":"note, docker, web, 100DaysToOffload, tech"},"tags":["note","docker","web","100DaysToOffload","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-04-a-fix-for-long-pressing-movement-keys-in-vscode-with-vim-mode","frontmatter":{"title":"A fix for long-pressing movement keys in VSCode with Vim-Mode","date":"2026-02-04","tags":"guide, note, editors, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","editors","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
