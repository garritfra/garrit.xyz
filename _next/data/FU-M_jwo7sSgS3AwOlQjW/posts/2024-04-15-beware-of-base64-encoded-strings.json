{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2024-04-15-beware-of-base64-encoded-strings","markdownBody":"\r\nI just encountered a fun little bug that I thought is worth sharing.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**: the base64 util breaks lines after a certain number of columns. Use a [flag](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/base64.1.html) to specify \"don't break\". Here's the commit that fixes the issue:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1588\" alt=\"image (3)\" src=\"https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/assets/32395585/dba76692-c89f-44da-b70a-f6732a406d75\">\r\n\r\nIt started when we noticed that a cronjob that used wget to regularly call an endpoint failed on one specific environment. The endpoint uses [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), which is essentially a header with a [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded representation of a username and password. [Curl](https://curl.se/) has this functionality [built in](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-u), but to keep the attack surface as small as possible, we decided to stick to [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), which is part of busybox, to keep the container image size under 1 MB (!). After all, all we want to do is ping an endpoint.\r\n\r\nThis is the command we used up to this point:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwget --post-data=\"\" -O - --header=\"Authorization: Basic $(echo -n $BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD | base64)\" http://endpoint:8080/v1/cache\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe noticed that the request worked fine on non-prod environments, but it failed on production with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe HTTP header line [b2verlk1rwjsnutbcapkjh==] does not conform to RFC 7230. The request has been rejected.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter digging around for a while and separating out the individual pieces of the commands, I noticed that the subcommand to build the header value (`echo -n $BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD | base64`) behaved differently on prod vs. non-prod. The password on prod is way longer compared to the other environments. Let's run this command with a short input:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/ $ echo -n someuser:somepassword | base64\r\nc29tZXVzZXI6c29tZXBhc3N3b3Jk\r\n/ $\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd again with a long input:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/ $ echo -n someuser:somepasswordthatswaylongerthanthefirstonebutalsoverysecureandsafe | base64\r\nc29tZXVzZXI6c29tZXBhc3N3b3JkdGhhdHN3YXlsb25nZXJ0aGFudGhlZmlyc3RvbmVidXRhbHNv\r\ndmVyeXNlY3VyZWFuZHNhZmU=\r\n/ $\r\n```\r\n\r\nBingo! There's a rogue newline character in the output of `base64`. The fix is very straight-forward. Using the `-w0` [flag for base64](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/base64.1.html), we can force the output to be on the same line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/ $ echo -n someuser:somepasswordthatswaylongerthanthefirstonebutalsoverysecureandsafe | base64 -w0\r\nc29tZXVzZXI6c29tZXBhc3N3b3JkdGhhdHN3YXlsb25nZXJ0aGFudGhlZmlyc3RvbmVidXRhbHNvdmVyeXNlY3VyZWFuZHNhZmU=\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis eventually fixed the issue. Not something I would've ever thought of!\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Beware of base64 encoded strings","date":"2024-04-15","tags":"guide, note, learnings, web, til, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","learnings","web","til","tech","programming"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-04-a-fix-for-long-pressing-movement-keys-in-vscode-with-vim-mode","frontmatter":{"title":"A fix for long-pressing movement keys in VSCode with Vim-Mode","date":"2026-02-04","tags":"guide, note, editors, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","editors","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
