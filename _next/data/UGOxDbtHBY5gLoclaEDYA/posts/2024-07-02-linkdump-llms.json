To \"digest\" my reading list of cool articles and projects regarding LLMs, I assembled the following list. If you're also interested but haven't started your journey into this neverending rabbit hole, these may contain some good pointers:\r\n\r\n## Running LLMs\r\n\r\n- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) - Host different LLMs locally (extremely easy!)\r\n- [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai) - Like Ollama but more scalable and production-ready\r\n- [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile) - LLMs as a single, portable binary\r\n\r\n## Building Chatbots & Applications\r\n\r\n- [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) - Framework for building LLM applications\r\n- [create-llama](https://github.com/run-llama/create-llama/) - LlamaIndex template generator (perfect for if you don't know how to structure your app)\r\n- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) - Like LlamaIndex with a less clean interface IMO\r\n- [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/overview/intro) - Another LLM framework. Haven't tested it though\r\n- [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) - For integrating your LLM app into a web frontend\r\n\r\n## Training and finetuning\r\n\r\n- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) - GitHub but for LLMs\r\n- [LoRA for Fine-Tuning LLMs explained with codes and example](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/lora-for-fine-tuning-llms-explained-with-codes-and-example-62a7ac5a3578) - Great LoRA Primer\r\n- [AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain) - NoCode LLM finetuning\r\n- [llm-toolkit](https://github.com/georgian-io/LLM-Finetuning-Toolkit) - Another finetuning framework\r\n- [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) - End to End platform for LLM training\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous projects\r\n\r\n- [llama-fs](https://github.com/iyaja/llama-fs) - Self-organinizing filesystem\r\n- [paramount](https://github.com/ask-fini/paramount) - Measure agent accuracy\r\n\r\n## Blogs\r\n\r\n- [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms/) - Awesome posts from a LLM enthusiast\r\n- [Matt Richard](https://matt-rickard.com/tags/ai) - Matt is currently inactive, but his blog is a treasure trove\r\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: LLMs","date":"2024-07-02","tags":"note, tech, linkdump, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","linkdump","llm","ai"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
