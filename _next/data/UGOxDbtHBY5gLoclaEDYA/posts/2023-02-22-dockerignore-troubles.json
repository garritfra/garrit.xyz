{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-02-22-dockerignore-troubles","markdownBody":"\r\nI commonly used to create a `.Dockerignore` file next to my `Dockerfile`. After countless hours of ignoring the problems in my setup, I found out that the uppercase `.Dockerignore` doesn't get picked up by Docker on MacOS. Only the lowercase `.dockerignore` is valid.\r\n\r\nI didn't find official documentation on this, but I think it's because both MacOS and Linux are case-sensitive, while Windows isn't. I don't remember why I got used to the `.Dockerignore` convention, but I swear I saw someone using it in the wild. Or it's my (un)logical reasoning that, because `Dockerfile` is uppercased, `.Dockerignore` should be uppercased as well.\r\n\r\nEither way, stay away from `.Dockerfile`s and stick to `.dockerfile`s.\r\n\r\nThis is post 050 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Dockerignore troubles","date":"2023-02-22","tags":"note, docker, web, 100DaysToOffload, tech"},"tags":["note","docker","web","100DaysToOffload","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-07-02-linkdump-llms","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: LLMs","date":"2024-07-02","tags":"note, tech, linkdump, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","linkdump","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
