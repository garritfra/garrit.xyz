{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2024-06-03-i-just-cleaned-up-40-gb-of-brew-caches","markdownBody":"\r\n> **EDIT**: This trick will probably not be as effective on your system as it was on my system. After writing this post I realized that I had the `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP=1` flag enabled on my system.\r\n\r\nMy system (MacOS) is getting more cluttered the more I use it. I'm sure you can relate. If you're using [Brew](https://brew.sh/) as your package manager (which you should ðŸ˜‰), you might want to consider running the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew cleanup -s\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some reason this failed after some time with a \"directory not found\" error, but you can just run it again and it will continue cleaning up old caches. Once it was done, this freed up **40 GB of disk space** on my system. It might make sense to run this as a cronjob? Either way, I just wanted to jot this down before I enevitably forget this, as usual.\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"I just cleaned up 40 GB of Brew caches","date":"2024-06-03","tags":"guide, note, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-07-02-linkdump-llms","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: LLMs","date":"2024-07-02","tags":"note, tech, linkdump, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","linkdump","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
