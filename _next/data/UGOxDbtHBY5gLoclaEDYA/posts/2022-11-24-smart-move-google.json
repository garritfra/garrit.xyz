{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-11-24-smart-move-google","markdownBody":"\nFor as long as I can remember, `maps.google.com` was the defacto domain for\nGoogle Maps. Also for as long as I can remember, I allowed this domain to use\nthe location services of my browser.\n\nYesterday I was asked to allow the usage of location services for Google Maps\nseemingly out of nowhere. Of course I accepted. After all, I just wanted to\ncheck a route to a local business and I was in a hurry. Back home I opened\nGoogle Maps again, and noticed that `maps.google.com` now redirects to\n`google.com/maps`. This implies that the permissions I give to Google Maps now\napply to **all** of Googles services hosted under this domain. So far I only\nidentified Google Flights to have made the same switch (`google.com/flights`),\nthough I'm sure they're just beginning to transfer their services to the main\n`google.com` domain.\n\nCongratulations, you now have permission to geo-track me across **all** of your\nservices.\n\nSmart move, Google.\n\nThis is post 043 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n---\n\nThis post generated some interesting discussions on\n[HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33729345).\n\n### Backlinks\n\n- [Google Bypasses Privacy, Puts Usersâ€™ Data on the Map](https://analyticsindiamag.com/google-bypasses-privacy-puts-users-data-on-the-map/)\n- [Last Week in Local - December 5, 2022](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EfB2yqlh7B62701mzc82v)\n- [Softantenna](https://softantenna.com/blog/google-smart-move/) ([English](https://softantenna-com.translate.goog/blog/google-smart-move/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp))\n- [Google kann euren Standort unter UmstÃ¤nden mit allen Services verfolgen](https://stadt-bremerhaven.de/google-kann-euren-standort-unter-umstaenden-mit-allen-services-verfolgen/) ([English](https://stadt--bremerhaven-de.translate.goog/google-kann-euren-standort-unter-umstaenden-mit-allen-services-verfolgen/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp))\n- [zive.cz](https://www.zive.cz/clanky/google-vymyslel-figl-jak-nas-plosne-sledovat-stacilo-mapam-zmenit-adresu/sc-3-a-219564/default.aspx) ([English](https://www-zive-cz.translate.goog/clanky/google-vymyslel-figl-jak-nas-plosne-sledovat-stacilo-mapam-zmenit-adresu/sc-3-a-219564/default.aspx?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp))\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Smart Move, Google","date":"2022-11-24","tags":"note, 100DaysToOffload, practices, tech, rant"},"tags":["note","100DaysToOffload","practices","tech","rant"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-07-02-linkdump-llms","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: LLMs","date":"2024-07-02","tags":"note, tech, linkdump, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","linkdump","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
