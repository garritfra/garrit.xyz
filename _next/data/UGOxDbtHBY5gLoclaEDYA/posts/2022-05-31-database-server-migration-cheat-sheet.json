{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-05-31-database-server-migration-cheat-sheet","markdownBody":"\nI just finished migrating a postgres database to a new host. To remember how to\ndo it next time, I'm writing down the commands I used here.\n\nI usually just shut down the database and then copy the local directory where\nthe volume was mounted onto the new host. This time though, I seemed to be\ngetting some I/O errors, so I had to do it the \"right\" way.\n\nTo be fair, this note is based on\n[this](https://www.netguru.com/blog/how-to-dump-and-restore-postgresql-database)\nguide. I modified it to fit my workflow with docker.\n\n## Creating a dump\n\nLog into the old host:\n\n```\nssh <user>@host\n```\n\nConnect to the postgres-container:\n\n```\ndocker exec -ti myservice_db_1 /bin/bash\n```\n\nCreate a dump. You can name your dump as you wish - I'm using dates to\ndistinguish multiple dumps:\n\n```\npg_dump -U db_user db_name > db_name_20220531.sql\n```\n\nCopy the dump to the host machine:\n\n```\ndocker cp myservice_db_1:/db_name_20220531.sql ~/\n```\n\n## Moving the dump to the new host\n\nThe easiest way to get the dump off of the old server and onto the new one is to\nuse your local machine as a middleman.\n\nFirst, download the dump to your machine:\n\n```\nscp <user>@<host>:~/db_name_20220531.sql .\n```\n\nThen, do the same thing but reversed, with the new host:\n\n```\nscp ./db_name_20220531.sql <user>@<host>:~/\n```\n\n## Restoring the dump\n\nFirst, connect to the new host:\n\n```\nssh <user>@<host>\n```\n\nAssuming the docker service is already running on the new host, attach to the\ndb-container, just like above:\n\n```\ndocker exec -ti myservice_db_1 /bin/bash\n```\n\nThis time, we have to do some fiddling on the database, so attach a session to\npostgres using their cli:\n\n```\npsql -U my_user\n```\n\nBefore \"resetting\" the existing DB to apply the dump, we have to connect to\nanother database. The `postgres` DB is always there, so you can use that.\n\n```\n\\c postgres\n```\n\nNow, we drop the existing DB and re-add it:\n\n```sql\ndrop database database_name;\ncreate database database_name with owner your_user_name;\n```\n\nAnd now, the moment you've been waiting for! Leave the psql-session and apply\nthe dump:\n\n```\npsql -U db_user db_name < db_name_20220531.sql\n```\n\nThat's all! You now have the exact copy of production database available on your\nmachine.\n\nThis is post 032 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Postgres Docker Container Migration Cheat Sheet","date":"2022-05-31","tags":"note, guide, 100DaysToOffload, database, docker, postgres, homelab, tech"},"tags":["note","guide","100DaysToOffload","database","docker","postgres","homelab","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-07-02-linkdump-llms","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: LLMs","date":"2024-07-02","tags":"note, tech, linkdump, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","linkdump","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
