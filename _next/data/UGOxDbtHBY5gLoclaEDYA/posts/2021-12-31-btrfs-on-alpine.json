{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2021-12-31-btrfs-on-alpine","markdownBody":"\nI'm currently in the midst of migrating some of my infrastructure from the cloud\nto \"on prem\", aka a local server, aka my old PC. I wanted to try alpine linux as\nthe host OS to see how it behaves as a lightweight server distro.\n\nSo far it stands up quite nicely, it has everything you'd expect from a\nlinux-based operating system. The only problem I encountered was getting BTRFS\nto work out of the box. Here are some things you should know when using BTRFS on\nAlpine linux.\n\n### Installing BTRFS\n\nInstalling BTRFS is relatively straight forward. Simply install the package and\ntell Alpine to load the module on startup:\n\n```\napk add btrfs-progs\necho btrfs >> /etc/modules\n```\n\nTo load the module right away, you can use the following command:\n\n```\nmodprobe btrfs\n```\n\n### Mounting a volume\n\nIf you try mounting a btrfs volume via your fstab, you will get an error. This\nis because BTRFS does not know about the drives yet when the filesystems are\nmounted. To work around this, you can create an OpenRC service that runs a\n`btrfs scan` to detect the drives. To do so, create a service under\n`/etc/init.d/btrfs-scan` with the following content:\n\n```sh\n#!/sbin/openrc-run\n\nname=\"btrfs-scan\"\n\ndepend() {\n  before localmount\n}\n\nstart() {\n  /sbin/btrfs device scan\n}\n```\n\nMake the service executable and register it:\n\n```\nchmod +x /etc/init.d/btrfs-scan\nrc-update add btrfs-scan boot\n```\n\nNow, you should be able to add the volume to your `/etc/fstab`:\n\n```\nUUID=abcdef-0055-4958-990f-1413ed1186ec  /var/data  btrfs   defaults,nofail,subvol=@  0  0\n```\n\nAfter a reboot, you should be able to see the drive mounted at `/var/data`.\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Nathan Parsons - \"Using BTRFS on Alpine Linux\"](https://nparsons.uk/blog/using-btrfs-on-alpine-linux)\n- [A bug report about this problem](https://gitlab-test.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues/9539)\n\nThis is post 023 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"BTRFS on Alpine Linux","date":"2021-12-31","tags":"linux, infrastructure, note, guide, 100DaysToOffload, homelab, tech"},"tags":["linux","infrastructure","note","guide","100DaysToOffload","homelab","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-07-02-linkdump-llms","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸ”— Linkdump: LLMs","date":"2024-07-02","tags":"note, tech, linkdump, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","linkdump","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
