{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-05-19-work-batch-sizing","markdownBody":"\nI've been playing \n[Carcassonne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)) a lot with my girlfriend recently. It's a boardgame about building cities, roads and farms, and each completed \"project\" earns you some amount of points. The twist is that there's only a limited number of tiles, and once all tiles are used, the game is over unfinished projects are discarded.\n\nThe first couple of playthroughs I tried to maximize my score by increasing the number of projects I actively had going. I'd start a new city or road whenever I could, thinking that the multipliers you sometimes get would pay off in the end. Boy was I wrong.\n\nWhere I'm from, we have multiple sayings for this approach. \"Having too many irons in the fire\" or \"dancing on too many parties\". I was too busy starting new projects instead of making actual progress.\n\nA far better approach is to finish projects early, earning less points, but with a greater certainty that they will pay off. With every project you start, the likelyhood of the other projects paying off decreases.\n\nKeeping batch sizes small was a key concept of the [lean manufacturing movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) in the 1980s, and has since been adopted by the [DevOps movement](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) for the IT industry. If you want to learn more about this topic, you should check out [The DevOps Handbook](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-devops-handbook-second-edition/). It goes well beyond the basics of making IT processes more productive and efficient.\n\nAfter realizing that small batch sizes are the key to success, I haven't lost a game of Carcassonne since. I hope you're not reading this, honey.ðŸ¤­\n\n---\n\nThis is post 068 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Optimizing work batch size","date":"2023-05-19","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, learnings, life, devops, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","learnings","life","devops","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-12-29-2024-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2024 in Review","date":"2024-12-29","tags":"note, life, review"},"tags":["note","life","review"]},{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
