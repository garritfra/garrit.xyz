However, it\nhas some really annoying problems that don't seem to get attention by Apple.\nThis is a list of things that personally bother me. I will try to update it\nwhenever I encounter new issues.\n\n- ~~When plugging in a external monitor, some native Windows can't be used with a\n  mouse anymore. Restart required to fix.~~ (This seems to be fixed)\n- Dash-to-dock sometimes doesn't work for fullscreen-applications.\n- When opening a fullscreen window from the workspace-overview, the dock\n  sometimes stays visible. Has to be manually hovered to hide.\n- When using a chromium-based browser on an external monitor in\n  fullscreen-mode, the menu-bar sometimes doesn't appear when hovered.\n- When switching from the internal to an external monitor, the workspace\n  alignment is not how I left it.\n\nThis is post 034 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"A list of bugs in MacOS","date":"2022-06-14","tags":"note, 100DaysToOffload, MacOS, tech, rant"},"tags":["note","100DaysToOffload","MacOS","tech","rant"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-03-25-container-interfaces","frontmatter":{"title":"About Container Interfaces","date":"2025-03-25","tags":"infrastructure, note, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","note","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
