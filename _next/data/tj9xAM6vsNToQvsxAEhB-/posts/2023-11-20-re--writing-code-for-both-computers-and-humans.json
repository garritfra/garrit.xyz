{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-11-20-re--writing-code-for-both-computers-and-humans","markdownBody":"\r\n> This is a reply to Tony Mottaz' [blog post](https://www.tonymottaz.com/blog/code-for-computers-and-humans/) about code that's easy to understand for humans.\r\n\r\nThe understandability of a piece of code can be measured by how much time one needs to grasp its behavior. Less cognitive load usually means easier, and therefore faster, to understand.\r\n\r\nTony argues that the verbose version of the code (`isNaN(defaultValue) ? NaN : defaultValue;`) is better than the optimized version (`defaultValue;`) because it proves that the author has thought of the possible sideeffect.\r\n\r\nHowever, I personally think this is in fact bad code. Although the code is **trying** to make obvious what it's doing, Tony had to pause and think about why it's written this way. This probably interrupted their flow of work, which is highly undesired. A short comment should have the same effect while keeping the reader in their flow. This is a perfect example for the \"[comment the why, now the how](https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/code-comments-why-not-how/)\" mantra.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed Tony's post. It does a great job emphasizing that we should be curious about the code we read and write.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 086 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"re: Writing code for both computers and humans","date":"2023-11-20","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, practices, opinion, web, javascript, tech, reply"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","practices","opinion","web","javascript","tech","reply"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-02-the-cult-of-done-manifesto","frontmatter":{"title":"The Cult of Done Manifesto","date":"2026-02-02","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, quote"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","quote"]},{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
