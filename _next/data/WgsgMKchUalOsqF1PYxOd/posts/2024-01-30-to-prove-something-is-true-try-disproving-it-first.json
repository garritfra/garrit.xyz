If you think something is true, try as hard as you can to prove that it's false.\r\n\r\nDisproving a theory is core to the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method). Only when we validate that something cannot be false, we come closer to proving that it's true.\r\n\r\n## Source\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKA4w2O61Xo?si=2dtApWo8JmHOwqff\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"To prove something is true, try disproving it first","date":"2024-01-30","tags":"note, quote, practices, til, science"},"tags":["note","quote","practices","til","science"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-03-the-scientific-method","frontmatter":{"title":"The Scientific Method","date":"2026-02-03","tags":"note, practices, life, science"},"tags":["note","practices","life","science"]},{"slug":"2026-02-02-the-cult-of-done-manifesto","frontmatter":{"title":"The Cult of Done Manifesto","date":"2026-02-02","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, quote"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","quote"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-04-15-beware-of-base64-encoded-strings","frontmatter":{"title":"Beware of base64 encoded strings","date":"2024-04-15","tags":"guide, note, learnings, web, til, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","learnings","web","til","tech","programming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
