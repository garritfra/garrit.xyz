{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-04-29-weeknote-17-2022","markdownBody":"\nThis week was quite ordinary. We enjoyed the weather during walks in the park\nand got some chores done.\n\n## At work\n\nA major news this week was that GitLab decided to remove [certificate-based\ncluster\naccess](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/deploy_to_cluster.html#deploy-to-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-cluster-certificates-deprecated)\nto Kubernetes clusters sooner as we hoped. We're now fleshing out how to migrate\nto the newer\n[gitlab-agent](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/install/index.html).\n\nI also got some refactoring work done. In one of our projects, we're currently\nmigrating our GraphQL queries away from a HOC-pattern towards React hooks, using\nthe amazing\n[apollo-augmented-hooks](https://github.com/appmotion/apollo-augmented-hooks)\nlibrary for additional caching features.\n\n## Sideprojects\n\nI continued to work on a secret side-project of mine, but I don't want to spoil\nanything just yet.\n\nBUT! If you're good at writing and would like to help out writing a couple of\nparagraphs that can catch the users attention, [I'd love to hear from\nyou](/contact).\n\nThat's it for this week. Thanks for reading!\n\nThis is post 029 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Weeknote 17/2022","date":"2022-04-29","tags":"weeknote, 100DaysToOffload, life"},"tags":["weeknote","100DaysToOffload","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-03-the-scientific-method","frontmatter":{"title":"The Scientific Method","date":"2026-02-03","tags":"note, practices, life, science"},"tags":["note","practices","life","science"]},{"slug":"2026-02-02-the-cult-of-done-manifesto","frontmatter":{"title":"The Cult of Done Manifesto","date":"2026-02-02","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, quote"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","quote"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-12-29-2024-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2024 in Review","date":"2024-12-29","tags":"note, life, review"},"tags":["note","life","review"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
