{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-04-27-migrating-homeassistant-from-sd-to-ssd","markdownBody":"\r\nI finally got frustrated with the performance of my Raspberry Pi 4 running Homeassistant on a SD card, so I went ahead and got an SSD.\r\n\r\nThe migration was **very** easy:\r\n\r\n1. Create and download a full backup through the UI\r\n2. Flash Homeassistant onto the SSD\r\n3. Remove the SD card and plug the SSD into a USB 3.0 port of the Pi\r\n4. Boot\r\n5. Go through the onboarding procedure\r\n6. Restore Backup\r\n7. Profit\r\n\r\nIt worked like a charm! The speed has improved A LOT, and everything was set up as it should be. \r\n\r\n...Until we turned on the lights in the livingroom. My ZigBee-dongle, plugged into another USB port, wasn't able to communicate with the devices on the network.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging around, I came across several threads stating that an SSD over USB 3.0 apparently creates a lot of interference to surrounding hardware, including my ZigBee dongle. The fix was simple: either get an extension port for the dongle, or plug the SSD into a USB 2.0 port of the Pi. Since I didn't have an extension cord to get the dongle far away enough from the SSD, I went with the latter option for now. And that fixed it! The performance was much worse, but still better than the SD I used before. My next step will be to grab an extension cord from my parents. I'm sure they won't mind.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 066 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating Homeassistant from SD to SSD","date":"2023-04-27","tags":"100DaysToOffload, guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-13-n8n-nodes-open5e-n8n-community-node-that-lets-you-access-d-d-5th-edition-srd-content","frontmatter":{"title":"n8n-nodes-open5e: n8n community node that lets you access D&D 5th edition SRD content","date":"2026-02-13","tags":"note, tech, programming, n8n, automation, ttrpg"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","n8n","automation","ttrpg"]},{"slug":"2026-02-04-a-fix-for-long-pressing-movement-keys-in-vscode-with-vim-mode","frontmatter":{"title":"A fix for long-pressing movement keys in VSCode with Vim-Mode","date":"2026-02-04","tags":"guide, note, editors, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","editors","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
