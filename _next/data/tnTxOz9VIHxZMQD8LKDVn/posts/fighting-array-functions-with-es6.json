{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"fighting-array-functions-with-es6","markdownBody":"\nYesterday, I came across an interesting bug regarding JavaScript Arrays, and I wanted to share my approach to fixing it.\nAt a basic level, I wanted to pass part of an array to a function, but wanted to use the original array later on.\n\n```js\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlet something = arr.splice(0, 3)\ndo(something) // []\nDoSomethingWithOriginal(arr)\n```\n\nThinking that Array.prototype functions don’t mutate the array directly, I moved on with my day. This lead to a bunch of problems down the line.\nSome array methods in the EcmaScript specification are designed to mutate arrays, while others do not.\n\n### Non-mutating functions\n\n- Array.prototype.map()\n- Array.prototype.slice()\n- Array.prototype.join()\n- …\n\nThese functions do not mutate the array they are called on. For example:\n\n```js\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nlet partOfArr = arr.slice(1, 2);\nconsole.log(partOfArr); // [2, 3]\nconsole.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n### Mutating functions\n\n- Array.prototype.sort()\n- Array.prototype.splice()\n- Array.prototype.reverse()\n- …\n\nThese methods mutate the array directly. This can lead to unreadable code, as the value can be manipulated from anywhere. For example:\n\n```js\nlet arr = [5, 2, 4];\narr.sort();\nconsole.log(arr); // [2, 4, 5]\n```\n\nTo me, it is very unclear, which functions do, and which don’t mutate arrays directly. But, there’s a simple trick you can use to stop letting the functions mutate arrays directly, ultimately leading to more readable and reliable code.\n\n## Enter: The ES6 Spread Operator!\n\n![Spread Operator](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518297056586-889f796873e0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1225&q=80)\n\nTake a look at this snippet:\n\n```js\nlet arr = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4];\nlet sorted = [...arr].sort();\nconsole.log(arr); // [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]\nconsole.log(sorted); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nVoilà! We have a sorted array, and the original one is also around. The spread operator(`[...arr]`) is used to create a new array with every value of arr .\nYou can use this for arrays, as well as objects:\n\n```js\nlet obj = {\n\tfield: \"example\",\n};\nlet extendedObj = {\n\t...obj,\n\tanotherField: 42,\n};\nconsole.log(extendedObj.field); // \"example\"\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nES6 brought us awesome features like let and const assignments, as well as arrow functions. A more unknown feature however is the spread operator. I hope you now know how to use the spread operator, and that you can adopt it for cleaner and simpler code.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Fighting Array Functions with ES6","date":"2019-04-07","tags":"javascript, guide, programming, web"},"tags":["javascript","guide","programming","web"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-13-n8n-nodes-open5e-n8n-community-node-that-lets-you-access-d-d-5th-edition-srd-content","frontmatter":{"title":"n8n-nodes-open5e: n8n community node that lets you access D&D 5th edition SRD content","date":"2026-02-13","tags":"note, tech, programming, n8n, automation, ttrpg"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","n8n","automation","ttrpg"]},{"slug":"2026-02-04-a-fix-for-long-pressing-movement-keys-in-vscode-with-vim-mode","frontmatter":{"title":"A fix for long-pressing movement keys in VSCode with Vim-Mode","date":"2026-02-04","tags":"guide, note, editors, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","editors","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-02-27-a-trick-to-manage-frequently-used-prompts-in-claude-chatgpt","frontmatter":{"title":"A trick to manage frequently used prompts in Claude/ChatGPT","date":"2025-02-27","tags":"guide, note, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["guide","note","tech","llm","ai"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
