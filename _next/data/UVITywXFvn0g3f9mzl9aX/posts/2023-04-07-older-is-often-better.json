After being unhappy with the Bluetooth connectivity in the OnePlus Nord I bought in december of 2020, I bought a brand new Pixel 7 last december. I told myself that t would be using the OnePlus Nord for at least three years, preferably four, yet I gave in after two years due to some issue that could have been fixed with a pair of cable-headphones. I'm now asking myself again: am I able to use my new Pixel 7 for more than 3 years?\n\nI just stumbled upon a blog post called \"[My long goodbye to Windows XP](https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/my-long-goodbye-to-windows-xp)\", in which the author explains that he is currently replacing his 2008 laptop running Windows XP with a \"new\" PC running Windows 7. He states that he knew the ins and outs of this operating system, so why switch to a new one? Eventually he did switch, but to an OS that is already end of life.\n\nI totally love this. If you're happy with what you got, you shouldn't let a new feature dictate how to change your workflow. Does one really need the features introduced in some software/hardware/tool in the past year? Wouldn't it make sense to use the things that have been battle-tested for at least a few years?\n\nAs I said, I'm very guilty of living at the cutting edge of technology. Maybe it's time to slow down. I'm certain it would simplify a lot of things.\n\n---\n\nThis is post 063 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Older is often better","date":"2023-04-07","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, life, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","life","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-03-the-scientific-method","frontmatter":{"title":"The Scientific Method","date":"2026-02-03","tags":"note, practices, life, science"},"tags":["note","practices","life","science"]},{"slug":"2026-02-02-the-cult-of-done-manifesto","frontmatter":{"title":"The Cult of Done Manifesto","date":"2026-02-02","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, quote"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","quote"]},{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
