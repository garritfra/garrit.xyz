{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-04-29-weeknote-17-2022","markdownBody":"\nThis week was quite ordinary. We enjoyed the weather during walks in the park\nand got some chores done.\n\n## At work\n\nA major news this week was that GitLab decided to remove [certificate-based\ncluster\naccess](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/deploy_to_cluster.html#deploy-to-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-cluster-certificates-deprecated)\nto Kubernetes clusters sooner as we hoped. We're now fleshing out how to migrate\nto the newer\n[gitlab-agent](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/install/index.html).\n\nI also got some refactoring work done. In one of our projects, we're currently\nmigrating our GraphQL queries away from a HOC-pattern towards React hooks, using\nthe amazing\n[apollo-augmented-hooks](https://github.com/appmotion/apollo-augmented-hooks)\nlibrary for additional caching features.\n\n## Sideprojects\n\nI continued to work on a secret side-project of mine, but I don't want to spoil\nanything just yet.\n\nBUT! If you're good at writing and would like to help out writing a couple of\nparagraphs that can catch the users attention, [I'd love to hear from\nyou](/contact).\n\nThat's it for this week. Thanks for reading!\n\nThis is post 029 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Weeknote 17/2022","date":"2022-04-29","tags":"weeknote, 100DaysToOffload, life"},"tags":["weeknote","100DaysToOffload","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-12-29-2024-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2024 in Review","date":"2024-12-29","tags":"note, life, review"},"tags":["note","life","review"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]},{"slug":"2024-05-10-about-my-smart-g-shock","frontmatter":{"title":"About my 'smart' G-Shock","date":"2024-05-10","tags":"note, life, review, watches"},"tags":["note","life","review","watches"]},{"slug":"2024-05-08-i-sold-my-car","frontmatter":{"title":"I sold my car","date":"2024-05-08","tags":"note, life"},"tags":["note","life"]},{"slug":"2024-04-10-beating-elden-ring","frontmatter":{"title":"Beating Elden Ring","date":"2024-04-10","tags":"note, learnings, life, review, gaming"},"tags":["note","learnings","life","review","gaming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
