{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2022-05-31-database-server-migration-cheat-sheet","markdownBody":"\nI just finished migrating a postgres database to a new host. To remember how to\ndo it next time, I'm writing down the commands I used here.\n\nI usually just shut down the database and then copy the local directory where\nthe volume was mounted onto the new host. This time though, I seemed to be\ngetting some I/O errors, so I had to do it the \"right\" way.\n\nTo be fair, this note is based on\n[this](https://www.netguru.com/blog/how-to-dump-and-restore-postgresql-database)\nguide. I modified it to fit my workflow with docker.\n\n## Creating a dump\n\nLog into the old host:\n\n```\nssh <user>@host\n```\n\nConnect to the postgres-container:\n\n```\ndocker exec -ti myservice_db_1 /bin/bash\n```\n\nCreate a dump. You can name your dump as you wish - I'm using dates to\ndistinguish multiple dumps:\n\n```\npg_dump -U db_user db_name > db_name_20220531.sql\n```\n\nCopy the dump to the host machine:\n\n```\ndocker cp myservice_db_1:/db_name_20220531.sql ~/\n```\n\n## Moving the dump to the new host\n\nThe easiest way to get the dump off of the old server and onto the new one is to\nuse your local machine as a middleman.\n\nFirst, download the dump to your machine:\n\n```\nscp <user>@<host>:~/db_name_20220531.sql .\n```\n\nThen, do the same thing but reversed, with the new host:\n\n```\nscp ./db_name_20220531.sql <user>@<host>:~/\n```\n\n## Restoring the dump\n\nFirst, connect to the new host:\n\n```\nssh <user>@<host>\n```\n\nAssuming the docker service is already running on the new host, attach to the\ndb-container, just like above:\n\n```\ndocker exec -ti myservice_db_1 /bin/bash\n```\n\nThis time, we have to do some fiddling on the database, so attach a session to\npostgres using their cli:\n\n```\npsql -U my_user\n```\n\nBefore \"resetting\" the existing DB to apply the dump, we have to connect to\nanother database. The `postgres` DB is always there, so you can use that.\n\n```\n\\c postgres\n```\n\nNow, we drop the existing DB and re-add it:\n\n```sql\ndrop database database_name;\ncreate database database_name with owner your_user_name;\n```\n\nAnd now, the moment you've been waiting for! Leave the psql-session and apply\nthe dump:\n\n```\npsql -U db_user db_name < db_name_20220531.sql\n```\n\nThat's all! You now have the exact copy of production database available on your\nmachine.\n\nThis is post 032 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Postgres Docker Container Migration Cheat Sheet","date":"2022-05-31","tags":"note, guide, 100DaysToOffload, database, docker, postgres, homelab, tech"},"tags":["note","guide","100DaysToOffload","database","docker","postgres","homelab","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-13-n8n-nodes-open5e-n8n-community-node-that-lets-you-access-d-d-5th-edition-srd-content","frontmatter":{"title":"n8n-nodes-open5e: n8n community node that lets you access D&D 5th edition SRD content","date":"2026-02-13","tags":"note, tech, programming, n8n, automation, ttrpg"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","n8n","automation","ttrpg"]},{"slug":"2026-02-04-a-fix-for-long-pressing-movement-keys-in-vscode-with-vim-mode","frontmatter":{"title":"A fix for long-pressing movement keys in VSCode with Vim-Mode","date":"2026-02-04","tags":"guide, note, editors, tech, programming, vim"},"tags":["guide","note","editors","tech","programming","vim"]},{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
