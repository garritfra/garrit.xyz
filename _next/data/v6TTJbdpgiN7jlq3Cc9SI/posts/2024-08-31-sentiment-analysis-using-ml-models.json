{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","markdownBody":"\nI just rewrote parts of my [Positive Hacker News RSS Feed](https://github.com/garritfra/positive_hackernews) project to use an ML model to filter out any negative news from the Hacker News timeline. This method is far more reliable than the previous method of using a [rule-based sentiment analyzer](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.vader.html) through NLTK.\r\n\r\nI'm using the model [cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest?text=Messer-Angreiferin+verletzt+f%C3%BCnf+Menschen+in+einem+Bus), which was trained on a huge amount of tweets. It's really tiny (~500 MB) and easily runs inside the existing GitHub Actions workflows. You can try out the model yourself on the HuggingFace model card.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"522\" alt=\"grafik\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06f42df6-624a-4108-ada8-d0d37a53e693\">\r\n\r\nIf you want to subscribe to more positive tech news, simply replace your Hacker News feed of your RSS reader with this one (or add it if you haven't already):\r\nhttps://garritfra.github.io/positive_hackernews/feed.xml\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-13-n8n-nodes-open5e-n8n-community-node-that-lets-you-access-d-d-5th-edition-srd-content","frontmatter":{"title":"n8n-nodes-open5e: n8n community node that lets you access D&D 5th edition SRD content","date":"2026-02-13","tags":"note, tech, programming, n8n, automation, ttrpg"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","n8n","automation","ttrpg"]},{"slug":"2026-02-04-a-fix-for-long-pressing-movement-keys-in-vscode-with-vim-mode","frontmatter":{"title":"A fix for long-pressing movement keys in VSCode with Vim-Mode","date":"2026-02-04","tags":"guide, note, editors, tech, programming, vim"},"tags":["guide","note","editors","tech","programming","vim"]},{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
