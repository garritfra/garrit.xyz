I identified 4 main \"levels\" of infrastructure abstraction:\r\n\r\n## Level 1: A website on a server\r\n\r\nThis is the most straight forward way to host a website. A webserver hosted on bare metal or a VM.\r\n\r\n## Level 2: Multiple servers behind a load balancer\r\n\r\nAt this stage, you start treating servers as cattle rather than pets. Servers may be spun up and down at will without influencing the availability of the application.\r\n\r\n## Level 3: An orchestrated cluster of servers\r\n\r\nInstead of a server serving a specific purpose (e.g. webserver, DB server, etc.), a server becomes a worker for arbitrary workloads (see Kubernetes, ECS).\r\n\r\n## Level 4: Multicluster service mesh\r\n\r\nIf an organization manages multiple clusters (e.g. multiple application teams), they can be tied together into a [service mesh](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/glossary/#service-mesh) to better optimize communication and observability.\r\n\r\n## Level 5: ???\r\n\r\nHistory shows that we never stop abstracting. Multicluster service meshes are about the most abstract concept many people (including myself) can comprehend, but I doubt that this is the end of this journey. So, what's next for modern infrastructure?\r\n\r\nThis is post 049 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"What's next for modern infrastructure?","date":"2023-02-21","tags":"note, infrastructure, kubernetes, 100DaysToOffload, tech"},"tags":["note","infrastructure","kubernetes","100DaysToOffload","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-13-n8n-nodes-open5e-n8n-community-node-that-lets-you-access-d-d-5th-edition-srd-content","frontmatter":{"title":"n8n-nodes-open5e: n8n community node that lets you access D&D 5th edition SRD content","date":"2026-02-13","tags":"note, tech, programming, n8n, automation, ttrpg"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","n8n","automation","ttrpg"]},{"slug":"2026-02-04-a-fix-for-long-pressing-movement-keys-in-vscode-with-vim-mode","frontmatter":{"title":"A fix for long-pressing movement keys in VSCode with Vim-Mode","date":"2026-02-04","tags":"guide, note, editors, tech, programming, vim"},"tags":["guide","note","editors","tech","programming","vim"]},{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
