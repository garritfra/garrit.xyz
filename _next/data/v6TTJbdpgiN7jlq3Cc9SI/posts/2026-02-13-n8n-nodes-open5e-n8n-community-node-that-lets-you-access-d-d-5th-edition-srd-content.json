Each resource supports three operations:\n\n- **Get Many**: Retrieve multiple items with optional filters and pagination\n- **Get**: Retrieve a single item by its identifier (slug or key)\n- **Search**: Search for items by name or description\n\n## Example Workflows\n\n### 1. Random Encounter Generator\n\nCreate random encounters by fetching monsters filtered by challenge rating:\n\n1. Add an Open5e node to your workflow\n2. Select Resource: **Monster**\n3. Select Operation: **Get Many**\n4. In **Filters**, add:\n   - Challenge Rating: `5`\n   - Document Source: `wotc-srd`\n5. Toggle **Return All** ON to get all matching monsters\n6. Connect to a Function node to randomly select 3-5 monsters\n7. Format the output as needed (Discord message, email, etc.)\n\n### 2. Spell Lookup Bot\n\nBuild a Discord bot that looks up spell information:\n\n1. Use a Discord Trigger node to listen for commands\n2. Add a Function node to extract the spell name from the command\n3. Add an Open5e node:\n   - Resource: **Spell**\n   - Operation: **Search**\n   - Search Term: `={{ $json.spellName }}`\n4. Add a Function node to format the spell details\n5. Send the formatted spell info back to Discord\n\n### 3. Item Database Search\n\nSearch for magic items and weapons by name:\n\n1. Add an HTTP Request trigger or Form trigger to accept search queries\n2. Add an Open5e node:\n   - Resource: **Magic Item** (or **Weapon**)\n   - Operation: **Search**\n   - Search Term: `={{ $json.query }}`\n   - Limit: `10`\n3. Format and return the results\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis is my first n8n community node. Contributions are welcome!
