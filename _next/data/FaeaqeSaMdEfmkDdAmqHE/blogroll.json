If you have any\nrecommendations or you think your name fits on this list, feel free to [drop a\nmail](mailto:garrit@slashdev.space)!\n\n### Blogs\n\n**[Ben Stokes (Tiny Projects)](https://tinyprojects.dev/)** – Ben builds turns ideas into minimum viable projects that actually make money!\n\n**[Drew DeVault](https://drewdevault.com/)** – Drew admittedly has controversial opinions, but his blog is worth reading.\n\n**[Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk/)** – On blogging, simple websites and life on a farm.\n\n**[Matt Rickard](https://matt-rickard.com/)** – Very insightful short daily posts about Cloud Infrastructure, Entrepreneurship and AI.\n\n**[Randall Munroe (xkcd)](https://xkcd.com/)** – A blogroll without Randall is no blogroll.\n\n**[Ru Singh](https://rusingh.com/)** – Freelance developer writing about software development, tech and life.\n\n**[Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/)** – Author of [Datasette](https://datasette.io/). He writes about Data, SQLite and emerging technologies.\n\n**[Chris Siebenmann](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/)** – The life of a sysadmin. All about monitoring, infrastructure and software in general.\n\n**[Simone Silvestroni](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/)** – Opinions about a better world wide web, sustainability and audio.\n\n**[Joel Chrono](https://joelchrono.xyz)** – Joels blog is very similar to mine.

Tech, programming, Entrepreneurship and other important news. Sometimes a bit toxic, so I wrote a [RSS proxy](https://github.com/garritfra/positive_hackernews) that only shows entries with a positive sentiment.\n\n**[Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs)** – Very similar to Hacker News, but strictly focused on software development.\n\n### Podcasts\n\n**[CoRecursive](https://corecursive.com/)** – Every episode is about a piece of software being built.\n\n**[Google's SRE Podcast](https://sre.google/prodcast/)** – Google invented SRE practices. If you're an SRE, this should be on your radar.\n\n**[DevOps Paradox](https://www.devopsparadox.com/)** – Interesting discussions about DevOps and tech.\n\n**[Arrested DevOps](https://www.arresteddevops.com/)** – Very similar to DevOps Paradox. The two go along very nicely.\n\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
