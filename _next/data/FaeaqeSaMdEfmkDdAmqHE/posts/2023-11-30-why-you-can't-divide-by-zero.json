{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-11-30-why-you-can't-divide-by-zero","markdownBody":"\r\nI've always been wondering why dividing by zero is considered undefined. My intuitive answer would have always been \"infinity\" or \"zero\". I just had a discussion about this with a collegue who happens to have a degree in mathematics, and the way they explained it made it absolutely clear why it doesn't make sense to divide by zero.\r\n\r\n## Inverse Operations\r\n\r\nBefore understanding why dividing by zero is undefined, you first need to know about inverse operations. It's quite simple!\r\n\r\nAn example: `3 + 2 = 5`. The inverse of addition is *subtraction*, so the inverse of this equation is `5 - 2 = 3` or `5 - 3 = 2`.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to multiplication. The inverse of multiplation is *division*. So the inverse of `6 * 2 = 12` is `12 / 2 = 6` or `12 / 6 = 2`.\r\n\r\n## Dividing by zero\r\n\r\nLet's try to apply the inverse rule to the number zero, starting with addition. If `2 + 0 = 2`, then `2 - 0 = 2`.\r\n\r\nBut if we have `2 * 0 = 0`, the inverse of that would be `0 / 0 = 2`, which is just not true.\r\n\r\nDividing by zero breaks some fundamental laws of mathematics, which is why there's a general consensus that any equasion dividing by zero has no valid answer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is post 090 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Why you can't divide by zero","date":"2023-11-30","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, til, math"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","til","math"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-08-03-how-embedding-models-encode-semantic-meaning","frontmatter":{"title":"How embedding models encode semantic meaning","date":"2024-08-03","tags":"note, tech, math, llm, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","math","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-04-15-beware-of-base64-encoded-strings","frontmatter":{"title":"Beware of base64 encoded strings","date":"2024-04-15","tags":"guide, note, learnings, web, til, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","learnings","web","til","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2024-04-04-pandoc-convert-links-to-footnotes-the-easy-way","frontmatter":{"title":"Pandoc: Convert links to footnotes (the easy way)","date":"2024-04-04","tags":"guide, note, writing, til, tech, programming, pandoc"},"tags":["guide","note","writing","til","tech","programming","pandoc"]},{"slug":"2024-01-30-to-prove-something-is-true-try-disproving-it-first","frontmatter":{"title":"To prove something is true, try disproving it first","date":"2024-01-30","tags":"note, quote, practices, til, science"},"tags":["note","quote","practices","til","science"]},{"slug":"2023-12-19-another-reason-you-can-t-divide-by-zero","frontmatter":{"title":"Another reason why you can't divide by zero","date":"2023-12-19","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, til, math"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","til","math"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
