{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-03-21-i-wont-buy-a-yubikey","markdownBody":"\nI have a YubiKey that I use for work, and I love using it. But I won't get one for my personal life.\n\nI've been thinking about this for some time now, but I ultimately don't think the benefits outweigh the hassle of always carrying around another device that I risk losing or breaking.\n\nA Yubikey provides a very good second factor, but so does my phone. My phone, just like a Yubikey, is locked behind a third factor (a pin or biometric sensor), so my phone essentially *is* a Yubikey. You can argue that the authenticator app on my phone (bitwarden) can be hacked, but I'm willing to take that risk if it means I have to reset all security measures on all accounts if I lose the key.\n\nSo, I'm not getting a Yubikey.\n\n### Replies & Mentions\n\n- [Kev Quirk: re: I won't buy a YubiKey](https://kevquirk.com/i-wont-by-a-yubikey/)\n- [Alson Kaw: Why I won't use a YubiKey](https://alsonkaw.com/muses/why-i-wont-use-a-yubikey/)\n\n---\n\nThis is post 058 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"I won't buy a YubiKey","date":"2023-03-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, privacy, security, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","privacy","security","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-03-25-container-interfaces","frontmatter":{"title":"About Container Interfaces","date":"2025-03-25","tags":"infrastructure, note, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","note","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-02-27-a-trick-to-manage-frequently-used-prompts-in-claude-chatgpt","frontmatter":{"title":"A trick to manage frequently used prompts in Claude/ChatGPT","date":"2025-02-27","tags":"guide, note, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["guide","note","tech","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
