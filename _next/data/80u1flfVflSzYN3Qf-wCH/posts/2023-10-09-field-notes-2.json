You may view my [About My Pocket Notebook](/posts/2023-09-09-everyday-carry-notebooks) post as part one of this series, since I wrote it near the end of my first notebook. I think it would be interesting to share my experience with this each notebook. One day I'll maybe have a nice history of posts that I can look back at. ðŸ™‚\n\nThis notebook lasted from 2023-09-10 to 2023-10-09, roughly one month. Here's a picture of it, after living in my back pocket every single day:\n\n![Field Notes #2](/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_2.jpeg)\n\n### What's in it?\n\nI used this notebook as a todo list, a travel journal, quick sketches, braindumps, simple calculations and much more. It's become a place to dump thoughts whenever and wherever I want to. Sometimes, it's genuinely interesting facts, like how to find north when all you have is a clear night sky.\n\n![Notes on how to find north at night](/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_2_page_5.jpeg)\n\nAnd sometimes it's just a random collection of uninteresting thoughts that wouldn't leave my head.\n\n![Random collection of notes](/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_2_page_32.jpeg)\n\nSome of these notes may mature into a project or blog post, like [the second to last note on that page](/posts/2023-09-29-undo-on-mobile-phones), while others just fade into the abyss. But that's okay! The point is to get these thoughts out of my head to work with them more easily.\n\n### What's next?\n\nI'll keep on writing! I got a bunch of new FIELD NOTES notebooks to fill up. Since my next notebook will likely live with me through the halloween season, I opted for the [Harvest](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/harvest) edition as my next notebook. ðŸŽƒ\n\n![Field Notes #3](/assets/posts/2023-10-09-field-notes-2/field_notes_3.jpeg)\n\nI'm curious to see where this one takes me.\n\n---\n\nThis is post 081 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).","frontmatter":{"title":"Field Notes #2","date":"2023-10-09","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, life, notebooks"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","life","notebooks"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-12-29-2024-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2024 in Review","date":"2024-12-29","tags":"note, life, review"},"tags":["note","life","review"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]},{"slug":"2024-05-10-about-my-smart-g-shock","frontmatter":{"title":"About my 'smart' G-Shock","date":"2024-05-10","tags":"note, life, review, watches"},"tags":["note","life","review","watches"]},{"slug":"2024-05-08-i-sold-my-car","frontmatter":{"title":"I sold my car","date":"2024-05-08","tags":"note, life"},"tags":["note","life"]},{"slug":"2024-04-10-beating-elden-ring","frontmatter":{"title":"Beating Elden Ring","date":"2024-04-10","tags":"note, learnings, life, review, gaming"},"tags":["note","learnings","life","review","gaming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
