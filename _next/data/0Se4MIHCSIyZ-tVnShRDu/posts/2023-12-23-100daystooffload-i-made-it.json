These last couple of days, I've been sprinting towards the finish line with one post every day to finish the challenge until the end of the year. And I finally made it!\n\nI started this challenge with [this](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2021-01-11-100daystooffload) post on January 11th, 2021, which means it took me almost three full years to finish it. The original challenge was to write 100 posts in **one** year, so I'm way overdue. 😅 But that doesn't make me less proud to finish it!\n\nIf you're interested, you can find the list of all 100 of my posts [here](https://garrit.xyz/posts?tags=100DaysToOffload).\n\n## What I learned\n\nBefore starting this challenge, I sometimes struggled with putting out content on this blog. It felt like each post had to be perfect, and if it wasn't, I was scared to publish it.\n\nThe idea of #100DaysToOffload is to let go of this fear and *Just. Write.* This absolutely worked. I accepted the fact that not every post is perfect and [sometimes posting more often with worse quality makes way for better posts](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-04-01-quality-vs.-quantity).\n\nIn order to post more often, I also found ways to reduce the friction between me writing a text and publishing it to the blog. I've yet to cover this in a post, but I built myself [a handy script](https://github.com/garritfra/garrit.xyz/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish_via_issue.yaml) that turns the contents of a GitHub issue into a pull request, ready to be merged as a blog post. This enables me to write posts everywhere I want (like the one right now, which is written on my phone), instead of having to open my laptop, create a new file, write the post and commit it to the repository.\n\n## What's next?\n\nI will continue posting when I feel like it! I set myself the goal to publish at least 50 posts a year, but that's just a rough estimate. If I don't feel like blogging, I won't force myself to do it.\n\nAll in all, I'm very thankful for having taken part in this challenge. I met [a](https://kevquirk.com/) [bunch](https://joelchrono.xyz/) [of](https://claytonerrington.com/) [like-minded](https://dougbelshaw.com/) [folks](https://jlelse.blog/) that are happy to discuss whatever I'm rambling about, and it's great to read whatever they are rambling about as well! I'm also thankful for all the nuggets of information I got to share with you, and also with my future self (seriously, you won't believe how often I'm looking up old posts and being happy that I wrote that down!).\n\nThanks for reading, until next time!\n\n---\n\nThis is post 100 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"#100DaysToOffload: I made it!","date":"2023-12-23","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, learnings, meta, writing"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","learnings","meta","writing"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-02-the-cult-of-done-manifesto","frontmatter":{"title":"The Cult of Done Manifesto","date":"2026-02-02","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, quote"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","quote"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]},{"slug":"2024-06-27-testing-smtp-connections","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing SMTP connections","date":"2024-06-27","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, learnings, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","learnings","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-05-24-going-from-self-hosted-to-managed-software","frontmatter":{"title":"Going from self hosted to managed software","date":"2024-05-24","tags":"infrastructure, note, learnings, opinion, homelab, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","note","learnings","opinion","homelab","tech"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
