{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2020-12-18-update-december","markdownBody":"\nIt's christmas season! I hope you and your family are safe and sound. My main focus this month is to expand my knowledge about compilers, by [building one from scratch](https://sr.ht/~garritfra/sabre/). It's a compiler for a very simple language, but it gets the job done. So far, you can write [simple algorithms](https://git.sr.ht/~garritfra/sabre/tree/master/examples), and compile them to JavaScript. A more sophisticated C backend is in development, but I still need a plan for expanding the target-specific builtin functions to provide more features in the standard library. An important topic at the moment is the [documentation of the project](https://garritfra.github.io/sabre/). Since the compiler itself has gotten relatively stable, all the language-features now need to be captured and written down. There is also a [contributing guide](https://garritfra.github.io/sabre/developers/contributing.html), if you want to help out, or want to get into compiler design.\n\nStay home and stay safe!\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Updates, December 2020","date":"2020-12-18","tags":"update, note, life"},"tags":["update","note","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-02-the-cult-of-done-manifesto","frontmatter":{"title":"The Cult of Done Manifesto","date":"2026-02-02","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, quote"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","quote"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-05-20-no-matter-what-you-do-always-leave-a-breadcrumb","frontmatter":{"title":"No matter what you do, always leave a breadcrumb","date":"2025-05-20","tags":"note, practices, writing, life, tech"},"tags":["note","practices","writing","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2024-12-29-2024-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2024 in Review","date":"2024-12-29","tags":"note, life, review"},"tags":["note","life","review"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
