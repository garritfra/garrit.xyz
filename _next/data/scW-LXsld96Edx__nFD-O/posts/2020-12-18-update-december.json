{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2020-12-18-update-december","markdownBody":"\nIt's christmas season! I hope you and your family are safe and sound. My main focus this month is to expand my knowledge about compilers, by [building one from scratch](https://sr.ht/~garritfra/sabre/). It's a compiler for a very simple language, but it gets the job done. So far, you can write [simple algorithms](https://git.sr.ht/~garritfra/sabre/tree/master/examples), and compile them to JavaScript. A more sophisticated C backend is in development, but I still need a plan for expanding the target-specific builtin functions to provide more features in the standard library. An important topic at the moment is the [documentation of the project](https://garritfra.github.io/sabre/). Since the compiler itself has gotten relatively stable, all the language-features now need to be captured and written down. There is also a [contributing guide](https://garritfra.github.io/sabre/developers/contributing.html), if you want to help out, or want to get into compiler design.\n\nStay home and stay safe!\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Updates, December 2020","date":"2020-12-18","tags":"update, note, life"},"tags":["update","note","life"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-12-29-2024-in-review","frontmatter":{"title":"2024 in Review","date":"2024-12-29","tags":"note, life, review"},"tags":["note","life","review"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]},{"slug":"2024-05-10-about-my-smart-g-shock","frontmatter":{"title":"About my 'smart' G-Shock","date":"2024-05-10","tags":"note, life, review, watches"},"tags":["note","life","review","watches"]},{"slug":"2024-05-08-i-sold-my-car","frontmatter":{"title":"I sold my car","date":"2024-05-08","tags":"note, life"},"tags":["note","life"]},{"slug":"2024-04-10-beating-elden-ring","frontmatter":{"title":"Beating Elden Ring","date":"2024-04-10","tags":"note, learnings, life, review, gaming"},"tags":["note","learnings","life","review","gaming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
