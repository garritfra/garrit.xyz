It's a fascinating topic, so expect some more posts on this in the coming days and weeks.\r\n\r\nFor starters, I wanted to document how I got my first LLM running on my local machine (a 2022 MacBook Pro). [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) makes this process super easy. You just install it (`brew install ollama` in my case) and then run the model:\r\n\r\n```\r\nollama run llama3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will download the model and open a prompt, so you can start chatting right away!\r\n\r\nYou can think of Ollama as the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) CLI but for LLMs. There's a [directory of LLMs](https://ollama.com/library), and if a model has multiple different sizes, you can use it like you would pull a different docker tag:\r\n\r\n```\r\nollama pull llama3:8b\r\nollama pull llama3:70b\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe best thing about ollama is that it also exposes a web server for you to integrate the LLM into your application. As an example, here's how you would curl your local LLM:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d '{\r\n    \"model\": \"llama3\",      \r\n    \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Are you a robot?\" }],\r\n    \"stream\": false\r\n}'\r\n{\"model\":\"llama3\",\"created_at\":\"2024-06-17T11:19:23.510588Z\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"I am not a human, but I'm also not a traditional robot.

You just deployed your very own LLM. Pretty cool, huh?\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Host your own LLM","date":"2024-06-17","tags":"infrastructure, guide, note, homelab, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["infrastructure","guide","note","homelab","tech","llm","ai"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2025-03-25-container-interfaces","frontmatter":{"title":"Container Interfaces","date":"2025-03-25","tags":"infrastructure, note, tech"},"tags":["infrastructure","note","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-02-27-a-trick-to-manage-frequently-used-prompts-in-claude-chatgpt","frontmatter":{"title":"A trick to manage frequently used prompts in Claude/ChatGPT","date":"2025-02-27","tags":"guide, note, tech, llm, ai"},"tags":["guide","note","tech","llm","ai"]},{"slug":"2024-09-24-installing-mssql-client-drivers-for-a-php-application","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing MSSQL Client Drivers for a PHP Application","date":"2024-09-24","tags":"guide, note, web, tech, programming, php"},"tags":["guide","note","web","tech","programming","php"]},{"slug":"2024-09-01-AI-fog","frontmatter":{"title":"Mental AI Fog and how to cure it","date":"2024-09-01","tags":"note, ai, life, writing"},"tags":["note","ai","life","writing"]},{"slug":"2024-08-31-sentiment-analysis-using-ml-models","frontmatter":{"title":"Sentiment analysis using ML models","date":"2024-08-31","tags":"note, tech, ai"},"tags":["note","tech","ai"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
