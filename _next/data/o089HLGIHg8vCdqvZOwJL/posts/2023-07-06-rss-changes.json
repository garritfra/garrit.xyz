{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-07-06-rss-changes","markdownBody":"\nIf you're subscribed to this blog via [RSS](/rss.xml), you will soon likely see\na bunch of my posts re-appearing in your feed. For that, I apologize in advance!\n\nI'm planning to make two modifications. Firstly, I want to add a `id` property\nto all entries. So far, your reader has been likely been relying on the URL slug\nto identify an entry. Adding the `id` property makes this more flexible, but it\nalso means that your reader will think that there are new entries in the feed.\nThis will only happen once.\n\nSecondly, I want to reduce the amount of the entries. If you look at the\n[feed](/rss.xml), you'll see a lot of junk from way back, containing every word\nI wrote on this blog. Remember that this page is fetched periodically (usually\nevery hour for most readers) by **every** subscriber. That's a lot of traffic\nthat could be better put to use somewhere else. Not that it costs me anything -\nthis site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - but if this\nhelps reduce the carbon footprint of the site even by one gram, it's worth the\neffort.\n\nAs of the time of writing this post, by restricting the number of posts to 10,\nwe reduce the amount of traffic per client per hour from 272 kB down to to 24\nkB. That's over **2 GB** of traffic saved each year **per subscriber**!!\n\nThat's all - just a heads up. Thanks for your patience, you're awesome! ✌️\n\n---\n\nThis is post 071 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"PSA: RSS feed changes","date":"2023-07-06","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, meta, rss"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","meta","rss"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2024-04-11-a-simple-search-bar","frontmatter":{"title":"A simple search bar","date":"2024-04-11","tags":"guide, note, meta, web, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","meta","web","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2024-04-07-five-years-of-blogging","frontmatter":{"title":"Five Years of Blogging","date":"2024-04-07","tags":"note, books, writing, meta"},"tags":["note","books","writing","meta"]},{"slug":"2024-01-06-a-better-publishing-workflow-for-static-blogs","frontmatter":{"title":"A better publishing workflow for static blogs","date":"2024-01-06","tags":"guide, note, meta, writing, web, github, tech"},"tags":["guide","note","meta","writing","web","github","tech"]},{"slug":"2023-12-23-100daystooffload-i-made-it","frontmatter":{"title":"#100DaysToOffload: I made it!","date":"2023-12-23","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, learnings, meta, writing"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","learnings","meta","writing"]},{"slug":"2023-12-20-giving-my-blogroll-more-context","frontmatter":{"title":"re: Giving context to a blogroll","date":"2023-12-20","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, web, meta, reply"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","web","meta","reply"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
