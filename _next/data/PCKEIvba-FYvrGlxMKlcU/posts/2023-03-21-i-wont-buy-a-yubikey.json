{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"2023-03-21-i-wont-buy-a-yubikey","markdownBody":"\nI have a YubiKey that I use for work, and I love using it. But I won't get one for my personal life.\n\nI've been thinking about this for some time now, but I ultimately don't think the benefits outweigh the hassle of always carrying around another device that I risk losing or breaking.\n\nA Yubikey provides a very good second factor, but so does my phone. My phone, just like a Yubikey, is locked behind a third factor (a pin or biometric sensor), so my phone essentially *is* a Yubikey. You can argue that the authenticator app on my phone (bitwarden) can be hacked, but I'm willing to take that risk if it means I have to reset all security measures on all accounts if I lose the key.\n\nSo, I'm not getting a Yubikey.\n\n### Replies & Mentions\n\n- [Kev Quirk: re: I won't buy a YubiKey](https://kevquirk.com/i-wont-by-a-yubikey/)\n- [Alson Kaw: Why I won't use a YubiKey](https://alsonkaw.com/muses/why-i-wont-use-a-yubikey/)\n\n---\n\nThis is post 058 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"I won't buy a YubiKey","date":"2023-03-21","tags":"100DaysToOffload, note, opinion, privacy, security, tech"},"tags":["100DaysToOffload","note","opinion","privacy","security","tech"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"slug":"2026-02-13-n8n-nodes-open5e-n8n-community-node-that-lets-you-access-d-d-5th-edition-srd-content","frontmatter":{"title":"n8n-nodes-open5e: n8n community node that lets you access D&D 5th edition SRD content","date":"2026-02-13","tags":"note, tech, programming, n8n, automation"},"tags":["note","tech","programming","n8n","automation"]},{"slug":"2026-02-04-a-fix-for-long-pressing-movement-keys-in-vscode-with-vim-mode","frontmatter":{"title":"A fix for long-pressing movement keys in VSCode with Vim-Mode","date":"2026-02-04","tags":"guide, note, editors, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","editors","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-12-11-custom-entities-in-home-assistant","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Entities in Home Assistant","date":"2025-12-11","tags":"guide, note, homeassistant, homelab, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","homeassistant","homelab","tech","programming"]},{"slug":"2025-09-15-making-family-it-support-effortless-and-free","frontmatter":{"title":"Making family IT support effortless (and free)","date":"2025-09-15","tags":"note, life, tech"},"tags":["note","life","tech"]},{"slug":"2025-06-11-git-diff-ignore-all-space-makes-code-reviews-way-easier","frontmatter":{"title":"git diff --ignore-all-space makes code review way easier","date":"2025-06-11","tags":"guide, note, til, git, tech, programming"},"tags":["guide","note","til","git","tech","programming"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
