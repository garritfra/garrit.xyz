This week was quite ordinary. We enjoyed the weather during walks in the park
and got some chores done.

## At work

A major news this week was that GitLab decided to remove [certificate-based
cluster
access](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/deploy_to_cluster.html#deploy-to-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-cluster-certificates-deprecated)
to Kubernetes clusters sooner as we hoped. We're now fleshing out how to migrate
to the newer
[gitlab-agent](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/install/index.html).

I also got some refactoring work done. In one of our projects, we're currently
migrating our GraphQL queries away from a HOC-pattern towards React hooks, using
the amazing
[apollo-augmented-hooks](https://github.com/appmotion/apollo-augmented-hooks)
library for additional caching features.

## Sideprojects

I continued to work on a secret side-project of mine, but I don't want to spoil
anything just yet.

BUT! If you're good at writing and would like to help out writing a couple of
paragraphs that can catch the users attention, [I'd love to hear from
you](/contact).

That's it for this week. Thanks for reading!
