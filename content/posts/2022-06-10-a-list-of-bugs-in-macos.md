I've been using MacOS for years, and I was always happy with it. However, it
has some really annoying problems that don't seem to get attention by Apple.
This is a list of things that personally bother me. I will try to update it
whenever I encounter new issues.

- ~~When plugging in a external monitor, some native Windows can't be used with a
  mouse anymore. Restart required to fix.~~ (This seems to be fixed)
- Dash-to-dock sometimes doesn't work for fullscreen-applications.
- When opening a fullscreen window from the workspace-overview, the dock
  sometimes stays visible. Has to be manually hovered to hide.
- When using a chromium-based browser on an external monitor in
  fullscreen-mode, the menu-bar sometimes doesn't appear when hovered.
- When switching from the internal to an external monitor, the workspace
  alignment is not how I left it.
