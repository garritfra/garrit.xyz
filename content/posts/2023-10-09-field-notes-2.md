Today marks the completion of my second pocket notebook. You may view my [About My Pocket Notebook](/posts/2023-09-09-everyday-carry-notebooks) post as part one of this series, since I wrote it near the end of my first notebook. I think it would be interesting to share my experience with this each notebook. One day I'll maybe have a nice history of posts that I can look back at. 🙂

Here's a picture of my worn-in notebook #2, after living in my back pocket for the last month:

### What's in it?

I used this notebook as a todo list, a travel journal, quick sketches, braindumps, simple calculations and much more. It's become a place to dump thoughts whenever and wherever I want to. Sometimes, it's genuinely interesting facts, like how to find north when all you have is a clear night sky.

And sometimes it's just a random collection of uninteresting thoughts that wouldn't leave my head.

Some of these notes may mature into a project or blog post, like [the second to last note on that page](/posts/2023-09-29-undo-on-mobile-phones), while others just fade into the abyss. But that's okay! The point is to get these thoughts out of my head to work with them more easily.

### What's next?

I'll keep on writing! I got a bunch of new FIELD NOTES notebooks to fill up. Since my next notebook will likely live with me through the halloween season, I opted for the [Harvest](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/harvest) edition as my next notebook. 🎃

I'm curious to see where this one takes me.
