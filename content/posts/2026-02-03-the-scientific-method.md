[The Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) is widely accepted among researchers and academics to be the de facto standard of establishing truth.

Lately, I was wandering if parts of the scientific method could more often be applied to every day life. There are [many](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/science-fair/steps-of-the-scientific-method) [different](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/intro-to-biology/science-of-biology/a/the-science-of-biology) [resources](https://extension.unr.edu/publication.aspx?PubID=4239) out there explaining the scientific method, often with examples of how to apply it outside of an academic environment. The core method is always the same (in this case, taken from [sciencebuddies.org](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/science-fair/steps-of-the-scientific-method)):

> 1. Ask a Question
> 2. Do Background Research
> 3. Construct a Hypothesis
> 4. Test Your Hypothesis by Doing an Experiment
> 5. Analyze Your Data and Draw a Conclusion
> 6. Communicate Your Results
