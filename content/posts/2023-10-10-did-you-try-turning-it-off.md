Planning our week, checking the time, suming up two numbers, reading a book. Often, digital devices are our default answer to a problem at hand. We've become so used to being around a computer that we neglect that certain tasks could also be accomplished without it.

Often, we just need to [make a list](/posts/2023-06-25-make-a-list). Many of us have 10 todo-apps on our phone, each with its own bells and whistles. But do we really need those reminder notifications, tags, and priority levels? Most commonly, a pen and paper are all you need to remember what's on the agenda for today.

The next time you're faced with a foreign problem, try asking yourself if whatever you're doing is worth the complexity of the solution. Often, though of course not always, the analog solution is most efficient.
