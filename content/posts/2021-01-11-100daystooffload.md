For some time now, I've seen this #100DaysToOffload hashtag on my social medias. I knew that it was some kind of writing challenge, but I never thought about taking part in it. Since I recently started to blog more frequently though, I think this challenge could be very beneficial to my writing skills, and just jotting my thoughts down in general. So, starting with this entry, I will try to publish 100 (hopefully) useful posts on this blog within one year. My "deadline" for this will be January 11, 2022. I will post every entry to [my mastodon account](https://fosstodon.org/@garritfra).

This is post 001 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).
