God dammit. I can't tell you how often I had to look up how to create or extract a tar archive on linux. There are SOO many options!!

## Let's settle this once and for all

Here's how you create an archive:

```
tar cf archive.tar directory
```

Try to remember "Create File".

And here's how you extract an archive:

```
tar xf archive.tar
```

For this one, try to remember "(e)Xtract File".

And if there's some other compressions in the mix: keep looking it up!

Sorry for this dumb post. I'm sure you can relate to my feelings. ;)
