2022 has been an eventful year for me. We moved to a new apartment, went to a
couple of weddings (a good indication that we're getting older!) and finally
started traveling more often.

This year, I launched two projects: [darktheme.club](https://darktheme.club) and
[seeking-maintainers.net](https://seeking-maintainers.net). My goal for 2023 is
to make two other projects ready for production:

[Fling](https://github.com/garritfra/fling) is a household management app that
I've been [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)
with my girlfriend for over a year. I just recently implemented an account
system. You can in fact already download the app on the [play
store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.garritfra.fling) and
test it out, though in it's current state it's just a boring app for to-do and
shopping lists.

Another project I'm planning to launch is
[Kubinity](https://docs.kubinity.com/). The idea behind this project is to give
users access to Kubernetes by allocating a namespace in a shared cluster. This
allows for ultra cheap kubernetes hosting without the burden of maintaining and
scaling a cluster. It also comes with free HA!

## Predictions for 2023

- Meta will change course (again), and kill the "Metaverse"
- Cheap matter devices will enter the market. As a reference point: I predict
that there will be a matter-ready smart plug for under 20€ on Amazon.
- AI generated content will be regulated in some way
- Twitter is still around, but it's still not profitable
- I still won't have finished my

Overall, I'm feeling very optimistic about the upcoming year. Let's see if this
is still true at the end of this year, but let's not loose hope too early.

Happy new year!
