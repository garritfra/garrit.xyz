That's a wrap! 2023 was an exciting year for me. I started my new role as a [DevOps Engineer](/posts/2023-04-22-the-role-of-a-devops-engineer) at my current company, I got [two](https://www.golem.de/news/open-source-der-patch-basierte-git-workflow-soll-bleiben-2302-171585.html) [articles](https://www.golem.de/news/wertestrom-in-devops-das-projekt-am-laufen-halten-2312-180174.html) published on a prominent German news site and finally finished my [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge!

This year, I launched two projects: [sendpasswords.net](https://sendpasswords.net/) and [Positive Hacker News](https://github.com/garritfra/positive_hackernews).

In [last year's review](/posts/2023-01-02-welcome-2023), I said I wanted to launch [Fling](https://github.com/garritfra/fling), my household management app. Fling is currently in open alpha, so you can try it out [on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.garritfra.fling) or via the [hosted website](https://fling-list.web.app) to give feedback! I'm planning a public release very soon.

Furthermore, I wanted to launch [Kubinity](https://docs.kubinity.com/). This was a very ambitious project, and although it technically works, it's very hard to maintain due to high running costs, which I'm not ready to pay yet.

I have some more drafts for projects in private repositories. One project that I'm feeling comfortable to release next year is a website for the #10ShittyProjects (working title) hashtag. More on that hopefully later!

## Goals for 2024

Here are some personal goals that I want to set myself for the upcoming year. Some of them are already defined on my [impossible list](/impossible).

* Build a side project that generated at least 100€ of value
* Get a scuba diving license
* Do a 10 km run (I really need to start moving again)
* Sell my car
* Write at least 50 blog posts

## Prediction results

**"Meta will change course (again), and kill the "Metaverse""**

A [quick Google search](https://labs.sogeti.com/the-metaverse-is-dead/#:~:text=The%20Real%20Promise%20of%20VR%2FAR%20Lies%20in%20Training%20Simulations&text=Yet%2C%20as%20of%202023%2C%20we,Reality%20(AR)%20has%20diminished.) reveals that the metaverse as originally imagined is not dead, but it's focus shifted to a more enterprise-y approach. I must admit that this prediction was quite vague. Depending on whom you ask, the metaverse is [both alive and dead at the same time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat).

**"Cheap matter devices will enter the market. As a reference point: I predict that there will be a matter-ready smart plug for under 20€ on Amazon"**

I found [this](https://amzn.eu/d/iA9ZBQf) matter-enabled smart plug on Amazon for 19,54€. If this is a real product, I'd say my prediction is a pass!

**"AI generated content will be regulated in some way"**

Also a pass! On December 9th, the European union agreed on the [EU AI Act](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence) and will now become EU law.

**"Twitter is still around, but it's still not profitable"**

Twitter is in fact [still not profitable](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/twitter-statistics/#:~:text=Twitter%20generated%20%244.4%20billion%20revenue%20in%202022%2C%20a%2011%25%20decrease,a%20loss%20of%20advertising%20revenue.). I'll leave the "Twitter is still around" part up for debate, as it's now called X.

**"I still won't have finished my #100DaysToOffload challenge from 2021"**

Wrong!! In early December, I decided to push through and whip out one post a day. I [finished the challenge](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-12-23-100daystooffload-i-made-it)!


## 2024 Predictions

* Bitcoin will at last reach a value of 100,000$, following the [halving](https://www.nicehash.com/countdown/btc-halving-2024-05-10-12-00) likely happening in 2024
* SpaceX will send a [Starship](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/) prototype to moon or Mars
* Tesla cars a still not fully self driving ([reference](https://motherfrunker.ca/fsd/))
* Google will replace their main search with an AI chat bot (see [Bard](https://bard.google.com))

Let's see what 2024 brings to the table!
